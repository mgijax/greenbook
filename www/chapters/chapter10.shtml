<H3>Earl L. Green and Thomas H. Roderick</H3>

<P>The laboratory mouse has been and probably will continue to be the mammal of choice for experiments on the genetic effects of radiation. 
This is so because the existing inbred strains, the stocks bearing named mutations, and the already known genetic linkage groups and chromosome 
maps provide a desirable degree of experimental sophistication. In addition, the large numbers of mice required for mutation studies may be 
reared in relatively small space with relatively little expense. More importantly, as mammals, mice may help to bridge the gap between 
<I>Drosophila</I> and other small organisms, on the one hand, and human beings and other large organisms, on the other, in attempts to 
predict the effects of high-energy radiation on genetic constitutions not amenable to direct experimental analysis.

<P>The genetic effects of radiation are classifiable into three categories: the induction of mutations, the breakage of chromosomes, and the 
effects of these changes on populations. We use the term "mutation" to mean any heritable change in the genetic constitution detectable by 
breeding methods. The breakage of chromosomes by radiation and the related effects are discussed in 
<A HREF="chapter7.shtml">Chapter 7</A>. The other two aspects are discussed in this chapter.

<P><B>MUTATION RATES</B>
</CENTER>

<P>Little and Bagg (
<A HREF="#ref10-29">1923</A>) pioneered in attempting to induce heritable changes in the germ plasm of the mouse. Although it is 
believed that the variations they observed in the descendants of X-rayed mice may not have been induced by X-rays, still this study called 
attention to the need for such investigations and to the use of laboratory animals for the purpose. Within a few years their work was 
followed by studies by Hertwig and Snell and later by larger studies by Charles, Russell, Carter, Searle, Lyon, L&#252;ning, and 
others. Falconer, Wright, Haldane, and Woolf, among others, have contributed important concepts of theory and method.

<P>The most extensive investigations of radiation-induced mutations and mutation rates in mice have been carried out at the Oak Ridge National 
Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and at the MRC Radiobiological Research Unit at Edinburgh, Scotland, and Harwell, England. W.L. Russell at 
Oak Ridge and T.C. Carter at Edinburgh each started large-scale studies of mice exposed to radiation in 1947 with related but not identical 
major objectives and with practically the same genetic techniques. A few years later, the mouse stocks at Edinburgh were transferred to 
Harwell and in 1953 were supplemented by sublines from Oak Ridge to make the studies even more comparable. This section will be based 
mostly on these two studies.

<P>Russell (
<A HREF="#ref10-42">1954</A>) has thoroughly reviewed the studies up to 1952. Since then several reviews of the rapidly expanding literature on 
radiation mutagenesis of mice have appeared, including a later paper by Russell (
<A HREF="#ref10-46">1963</A>), opening the way to the preceding papers. We will refer to a few specific experiments in this section. References 
to studies not in the list of Literature Cited may be found in either the 1954 or 1963 papers of Russell.

<P><B>Types of mutation</B>

<P>Mutations may be classified with respect to type of cell (somatic vs. germinal), chromosomal location (autosomal vs. sex-linked), nature 
of effect (dominant vs. recessive, visible vs. lethal), and size of effect (major vs. minor, oligogenic vs. polygenic). The studies reviewed 
in this section deal predominantly with recessive autosomal visible mutations in spermatogonia because these are easier to detect than others 
in large routine breeding experiments.

<P><B>Cell stages</B>

<P>Male mice, exposed to 300 R or more of high-energy radiation, are usually fertile for about 3 weeks and then enter a sterile period for 
about 3 weeks and then enter a sterile period with lasts 4 weeks or more depending on the dose. Doses less than 300 R may depress fertility 
without a clear-cut sterile period. After the sterile period the males remain fertile throughout the rest of their lives.

<P>Matings in the presterile period make use of germ cells which were in postmeiotic stages (sperm, spermatids, spermatocytes) at the time 
of irradiation. Matings after the sterile period make use of germ cells descended from irradiated spermatogonia. As found by Hertwig, the 
types of genetic changes induced in the gonial stages are characteristically different from those in the postgonial stages. Irradiated sperm 
tend to transmit dominant mutations, whereas irradiated gonia tend to transmit recessive mutations. By selecting the interval of time between 
irradiation and copulation one may thus determine whether irradiation postmeiotic or premeiotic cells produce the sperm.

<P>Young adult female mice exposed to 50 R or more of high-energy radiation may produce one, sometimes two, litters and thereafter may be 
permanently sterile. Their ovaries contain a quite uniform population of oocytes, nearly all in a resting stage prior to the first meiotic 
metaphase and a few about to be extruded as fertilizable ova without yet having completed the second meiotic division. As a consequence, it 
is not possible to effect a clear-cut separation of germ cell stages in irradiated adult females. Females must be irradiated as fetuses to 
expose oogonia.

<P>The type of cell &#151; somatic or germinal &#151; in which a mutation occurs affects its detectability and, more importantly, one's 
judgment about the seriousness of the consequences. In this section we are concerned chiefly with the problem of detecting and measuring 
the frequency of mutations in germ cells exposed to high-energy radiation.

<P><B>Breeding tests</B>

<P>The objective of breeding tests of irradiated and control mice is to analyze the genetic constitution of single germ cells by examining 
the zygotes they produce or of somatic cells by examining the cell clusters they produce. This may require one, two, or three generations 
of breeding depending on the nature of the genetic change under investigation.

<P>There are four breeding systems each with a large number of variants useful in radiation genetic experiments with mice. We propose that 
the systems be called: parental outcross or P-cross, filial outcross or F<SUB>1</SUB>-cross, outcross-backcross or cross-backcross, and 
outcross-intercross or cross-intercross. These are operational terms referring to what one does with the mice and not to what type of genetic 
change he expects to find. Each of the systems may be used to detect several types of mutations.

<P><B><I>P-cross method.</I></B> Each parental mouse, irradiated or control, to be tested for mutations is crossed to an unrelated mouse 
and the progeny are scrutinized for phenotypic deviations or presumptive mutations (
<a href="javascript:windowf1001 = window.open('../figures/figure10-1.shtml', 'windowf1001', 'width=800,height=500,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf1001.focus()">Figure 10-1A</A>). 
Each viable deviant should be tested by further matings to establish whether a mutation has occurred. The 
P-cross method may be used to search for all types of dominant mutations &#151; autosomal or sex-linked, visible or lethal &#151; and, 
with appropriate choices of the mates in the cross, for specified types of recessive mutations as well. The rationale may best be explained 
by considering a few types of mutations. We shall denote alleles at a given locus as dominant <I>D</I>, recessive <I>r</I>, or wild type +, 
and newly induced mutations as <I>D*</I> or <I>r*</I>.

<P>If the mating type is +/+ x +/+ (autosomal) or +/+ x +/Y (sex-linked), the F<SUB>1</SUB> progeny will be +/+ or +/+ and +/Y, unless there 
is a new mutation. Either sex may be irradiated. Dominant visible mutations are indicated by the occurrence of some progeny with the 
<I>D</I>-phenotype. Since each F<SUB>1</SUB> mouse tests one treated or control gamete in combination with an untreated gamete, the relative 
frequency of the <I>D</I>-phenotype in the treated group, corrected for the relative frequency of the <I>D</I>-phenotype in the control group, 
is an estimate of the radiation-induced mutation rate at this one locus. If <I>n</I><SUB>1</SUB> and <I>n</I><SUB>2</SUB> are the numbers 
of F<SUB>1</SUB> mice tested in the control and irradiated groups, respectively, and if <I>v</I><SUB>1</SUB> and <I>v</I><SUB>2</SUB> are 
the numbers of mice with the <I>D</I>-phenotype in the respective groups, then <I>p</I><SUB>2</SUB> = <I>v</I><SUB>2</SUB>/<I>n</I><SUB>2</SUB> 
is the relative frequency or fraction of mice with spontaneous (<I>D</I> and radiation-induced (<I>D*</I>) mutations in the irradiated group 
and <I>p</I><SUB>1</SUB> = <I>v</I><SUB>1</SUB>/<I>n</I><SUB>1</SUB> is the fraction with spontaneous mutations (<I>D</I>) in the control 
group. The ratio (<I>p</I><SUB>2</SUB> - <I>p</I><SUB>1</SUB>)/(1 - <I>p</I><SUB>1</SUB>) is an estimate of the radiation-induced rate of 
mutation at the <I>D</I> locus. If <I>p</I><SUB>1</SUB> is very small, the difference (<I>p</I><SUB>2</SUB> - <I>p</I><SUB>1</SUB>) is a 
sufficiently accurate estimate of the induced mutation rate. If <I>q</I><SUB>1</SUB> = 1 - <I>p</I><SUB>1</SUB> and 
<I>q</I><SUB>2</SUB> = 1 - <I>p</I><SUB>1</SUB> and <I>q</I><SUB>2</SUB> = 1 - <I>p</I><SUB>2</SUB>, the induced rate is also estimated 
by 1 - (<I>q</I><SUB>2</SUB>/<I>q</I><SUB>1</SUB>).

<P>It may not often be practical to confine one's attention to a single locus. Therefore the progeny are examined for any departure from 
the expected type and, either supposing the departures to be due to dominant mutations or testing them by breeding to establish them as 
such, the resulting frequency relative to the total examined gives an estimate of the rate of mutation to dominant visible alleles in the 
genome as a whole. Computing the ratio given above gives the radiation-induced mutation rate per gamete.

<P>The irradiated and control mice should be mated with unrelated or distantly related mice to minimize the possibility of mistaking a 
recessive allele, present in the stock in a low frequency, for an induced dominant mutation. That is, if the mating is in fact 
<I>r</I>/+ x <I>r</I>/+, the <I>r</I>/<I>r</I> progeny may be erroneously scored as <I>D*</I>/+.

<P>If females are irradiated, recessive sex-linked mutations may appear in their male progeny. The mating +/+ x +/Y may 
produce <I>r*</I>/Y sons.

<P>One variant of the P-cross, the "specific locus" method, has been extensively used for detecting recessive mutations. If the irradiated 
and control mice are dominant homozygotes for one or more loci, say +/+, +/+, ..., and if they are mated with recessive homozygotes 
<I>a</I>/<I>a</I>, <I>b</I>, ..., mutations from + to <I>a</I>, + to <I>b</I>, ..., will be detected by the appearance of the recessive 
phenotypes among the progeny. The number of proved mutations recovered may be used directly to estimate the mutation rate at each locus 
tested, the treated rate being adjusted for the control rate to give an induced rate. Obviously the rates from several loci may be averaged.

<P>The P-cross method may be used to detect dominant autosomal lethals by a significant reduction in litter size, particularly if fathers 
are irradiated. If mothers are irradiated, litter size cannot be used to measure the incidence of dominant lethals, as Russell and Russell (
<A HREF="#ref10-43">1956</A>) showed. This must be done by using the ratio of the number of living embryos (<I>n</I> - <I>v</I>) to the number of 
corpora lutea (<I>n</I>). The induced rate is then estimated as 1 - (<I>q</I><SUB>2</SUB>/<I>q</I><SUB>1</SUB>).

<P>If males are irradiated, dominant sex-linked lethals may be detected by a deficiency of daughters. If females are irradiated, recessive 
sex-linked lethals may be detected by a deficiency of sons. Both litter size and sex ratio are so highly variable that changes in their 
magnitude are difficult to detect without enormous samples, except in cases of dominant semisterility (due to reciprocal translocations) 
which can be detected by the half-size of a few litters.

<P>The P-cross method or one of its variants has been widely used. In addition to its being used in the early studies by Hertwig and by 
Snell on the effects of X-rays and by Snell and Aebersold on the effects of neutrons, it has been used by most later investigators as well. 
Russell and Carter each devised a multiple recessive tester stock

<P>The absence of tabby males (<I>+ Ta +</I>/Y) among the backcross progeny of any one family of adequate size indicates 
that a lethal mutation is located on the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856197" target="_blank"><I>Ta</I></A> chromosome between the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856679" target="_blank"><I>Bn</I></A> and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856098" target="_blank"><I>Mo<SUP>br</SUP></I></A> 
loci. Auerbach <I>et al.</I> (
<A HREF="#ref10-1">1962</A>), in proposing and first using this method with mice, pointed out the difficulties of using these 
specific markers. As more sex-linked alleles are discovered in mice, new improved stocks may be synthesized for detecting 
sex-linked lethal mutations.

<P><B><I>Cross-backcross method.</I></B> This method, requiring three generations, is useful for detecting recessive visible 
and lethal mutations. Each exposed or control mouse in the zeroth generation (G0) is mated to a stock mouse with wild-type or 
specific mutant alleles. If a recessive mutation has occurred in some of the gametes, the progeny, each representing one gamete 
from an irradiated or control parent, will be heterozygous for an induced or natural mutation (<I>r*</I>?+ or <I>r</I>/+). 
These mutations are to be uncovered by two more generations of breeding: an outcross and a backcross. Accordingly, the G1 
mice are outcrossed to unrelated wild-type mice to produce prospective heterozygous carriers in G2. The G2 mice are, in turn, 
backcrossed to their parents to produce G3. Homozygotes (<I>r*</I><I>r*</I> or <I>r</I>/<I>r</I>) in G3 can be recovered if + 
mutated to <I>r*</I> or <I>r</I>, if the new phenotype is viable, and if a sufficient number of progeny have been reared to reduce 
the chance of nonrecovery to a low level. I <I>r*</I>/<I>r*</I> or <I>r</I>/<I>r</I> is lethal, its existence must be inferred 
from a reduction in litter size in G3 (
<a href="javascript:windowf1001 = window.open('../figures/figure10-1.shtml', 'windowf1001', 'width=800,height=500,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf1001.focus()">Figure 10-1<I>C</I></A>).

<P>Using this method, Carter and Phillips (
<A HREF="#ref10-11">1952</A>) found two new recessive visible mutations in the progeny of nonexposed mice, and Carter (
<A HREF="#ref10-3">1957<I>a</I></A>) found evidence for the induction of recessive lethal mutations, manifested by reductions in litter sizes.

<P>The strength of this method may be markedly increased by the use of single markers of selected linkage groups as Snell (
<A HREF="#ref10-57">1935</A>) proposed and, still further, by the use of two or more linked markers as Carter (
<A HREF="#ref10-4">1957<I>b</I></A>) proposed. Each marker having normal viability in homozygotes should appear in one-half of the progeny in G3. 
The absence of a marker class is evidence for a nearby induced recessive lethal mutation. The statistical problems of estimating mutation 
rates from the collected data may be quite formidable. They arise from the uncertainty of detecting all recessive mutations, present or 
induced in the G0 parents, through their failure to appear in litters of finite sizes three generations later. Falconer (
<A HREF="#ref10-17">1949</A>) has dealt with this problem by introducing the idea of reducing the number of incompletely tested gametes to 
the equivalent smaller number of completely tested gametes.

<P><B><I>Cross-intercross method.</I></B> This method, the first used for detecting recessive mutations in mice, also requires three 
generations. It is like the preceding method except that the outcross progeny in G2 are intercrossed instead of backcrossed, but its efficiency is less (
<a href="javascript:windowf1001 = window.open('../figures/figure10-1.shtml', 'windowf1001', 'width=800,height=500,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf1001.focus()">Figure 10-1<I>D</I></A>). 
For this method also Falconer (
<A HREF="#ref10-17">1949</A>) solved the problem of scoring the results to estimate the equivalent number of fully tested gametes.

<P>Haldane (
<A HREF="#ref10-23">1956</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref10-24">1957</A>) proposed a breeding design using the cross-intercross method. Males or females or 
both of a stock of mice homozygous for several known recessives are exposed  to radiation for one or more generations, ending 
with a generation (G1) not itself exposed. Recessive lethal mutations may have accumulated in these mice. The objective of further 
breeding is to detect the presence of such lethals by observing deficiencies in the recessive marker classes of an F<SUB>2</SUB> 
(=G3) generation, indicating that a lethal mutation has been induced at or near each known locus whose recessive class is deficient. 
Accordingly the G1 mice are outcrossed and their progeny are intercrossed to produce a multiply-segregating F<SUB>2</SUB> generation. 
The method has been used by Carter (
<A HREF="#ref10-6">1959</A>) and by Sugahara and his colleagues (
<A HREF="#ref10-63">Sugahara, 1964</A> and earlier).

<P>A related method is adapted to estimating recessive mutation rates within inbred lines being propagated for other purposes. 
Following a cross and one generation of intercrossing, brother-sister matings are continued indefinitely. The articles by Snell (
<A HREF="#ref10-59">1945</A>) and Woolf (
<A HREF="#ref10-65">1954</A>) set forth the theory of this method.

<P><B>Estimates of mutation rates</B>

<P>Charles (
<A HREF="#ref10-12">1950</A>) was the first to estimate the rate of induction of mutations by radiation, using fairly large 
samples of mice. His estimate of 7 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP> per roentgen per gamete was for all types of mutations, chiefly dominants, 
induced in sperm under repeated small doses of penetrating radiation. The very large scale studies at Oak Ridge and Harwell in 
the ensuing years have established the importance of specifying the sex, cell stage, test system, radiation quality, dose rate, 
and other variables in estimating mutation rates.

The data for male cells exposed to single doses of radiation at high and low rates are given first. Data on 
female cells are in the last two tables. The breeding methods and other distinctive features of each experiment are also given 
in the tables. This arrangement does not reveal the sequence of completion of the various experiments and so masks the excitement 
of the successive stages of discovery. This side of the story may be found in Russell's (

are given in two ways. First, if mutations of a designated type were detectable at all loci, the rate per 
gamete is given for the radiation does employed. For example, in row 3 of 
<a href="javascript:windowt1002 = window.open('../tables/table10-2.shtml', 'windowt1002', 'width=800,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt1002.focus()">Table 10-2</A>, 
five dominant visible mutations in 31,253 gametes gives an overall rate of 16.0 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP> per gamete exposed to 
200 R of acute X-rays. Dividing by 200 gives 80.0 x 10<SUP>-8</SUP>/R/gamete. This is called an overall dominant visible rate 
because all loci were presumably at risk and dominant visible mutations at any loci were detectable. In this example the rate 
also includes any spontaneous or natural dominant visible mutations and so must be adjusted to give an induced rate. Second, if 
mutations only at certain specific loci were counted, the rate per locus is given for the radiation dose employed. For example, in row 4 of 
<a href="javascript:windowt1002 = window.open('../tables/table10-2.shtml', 'windowt1002', 'width=800,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt1002.focus()">Table 10-2</A>, 
nine recessive visible and lethal mutations in 31,253 gametes tested gives a rate of 28.8 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP> 
for seven loci exposed to 200 R. Dividing by seven gives 4.1 X 10<SUP>-5</SUP>/locus. A further division by 200 gives 
20.6 x 10<SUP>-8</SUP>/R/locus. If the spontaneous rate is independently estimated as 6.2 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP> for seven loci, 
the adjusted or induced rate comes out at 16.2 x 10<SUP>-8</SUP>/R/locus. Leaving the rates on a per gamete or per locus basis, 
<a href="javascript:windowt1004 = window.open('../tables/table10-4.shtml', 'windowt1004', 'width=800,height=1000,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt1004.focus()">Table 10-4</A>. 
In the text a few rates are given on a per roentgen basis.

<P>The average mutation rate of seven specific loci to recessive visible and lethal alleles in postmeiotic male germ cells 
irradiated with 300 R of X-rays was estimated as 13.6 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP> per locus or 45.3 x 10<SUP>-8</SUP> per roentgen per locus (
<a href="javascript:windowt1001 = window.open('../tables/table10-1.shtml', 'windowt1001', 'width=800,height=500,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt1001.focus()">Table 10-1</A>, 
row 1). No extensive data are available for sex-linked lethals (
<a href="javascript:windowt1001 = window.open('../tables/table10-1.shtml', 'windowt1001', 'width=800,height=500,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt1001.focus()">Table 10-1</A>, 
row 2). Irradiated fetal spermatogonia gave a rate of 80.0 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP>/R/gamete for dominant visible mutations at all loci (
<a href="javascript:windowt1002 = window.open('../tables/table10-2.shtml', 'windowt1002', 'width=800,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt1002.focus()">Table 10-2</A>, 
row 3) and a rate of 20.5 x 10<SUP>-8</SUP>/R/locus for recessive visibles and lethals at seven specific loci, 
roughly one-half that of the postmeiotic rate (
<a href="javascript:windowt1002 = window.open('../tables/table10-2.shtml', 'windowt1002', 'width=800,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt1002.focus()">Table 10-2</A>, 
row 4). An earlier small-scale experiment had given a much smaller rate (
<a href="javascript:windowt1002 = window.open('../tables/table10-2.shtml', 'windowt1002', 'width=800,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt1002.focus()">Table 10-2</A>, 
row 5). A variety of experiments with all spermatogonial stages exposed to low dose rates and relatively 
low total doses of &#947;-rays have yielded too few data to provide good estimates of mutation rates (
<a href="javascript:windowt1003 = window.open('../tables/table10-3.shtml', 'windowt1003', 'width=800,height=800,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt1003.focus()">Table 10-3</A> 
rows 6 to 10).

<P>In the first large experiment, 48,007 progeny of males exposed to 600 R of acute X-rays and bred after the sterile period gave 
an induced mutation rate of 25.0 x 10<SUP>-8</SUP>/R/locus for recessive visibles and lethals at seven specific loci. By 1962, with 
a much larger sample, the improved estimate was very nearly the same: 22.1 x 10<SUP>-8</SUP>/R/locus (
<a href="javascript:windowt1004 = window.open('../tables/table10-4.shtml', 'windowt1004', 'width=800,height=1000,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt1004.focus()">Table 10-4</A>, 
row 20, 600R). This is about the same as the rate for fetal spermatogonia and about one-half the rate for 
postmeiotic stages. The spermatogonial mutation rates at 0, 300, and 600 R were satisfactorily fitted by a straight line, but the point 
for 1,000 R fell significantly below the line (
<a href="javascript:windowt1004 = window.open('../tables/table10-4.shtml', 'windowt1004', 'width=800,height=1000,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt1004.focus()">Table 10-4</A>, 
row 20). There is no obvious explanation of this result. It can be accounted for by supposing that spermatogonia 
are differentially susceptible to the action of large acute doses of radiation so that the observed drop in mutation rate at 1,000 R is possibly 
due to cell selection. Estimates of other rates for acute exposures of spermatogonia are also given in 
<a href="javascript:windowt1004 = window.open('../tables/table10-4.shtml', 'windowt1004', 'width=800,height=1000,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt1004.focus()">Table 10-4</A>, 
rows 11 to 18 and 21.

<P>While the results of exposures to acute doses were being accumulated, the results of exposure of males to chronic 
radiation suggested that radiation at low dose rates (Table 
<a href="javascript:windowt1005 = window.open('../tables/table10-5.shtml', 'windowt1005', 'width=800,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt1005.focus()">10-5</A>, 
rows 22 to 24). Further, mutation rates in oocytes also turned out to depend upon dose rate. Since nearly 
all oocytes in young adult females, unlike spermatogonia in young adult males, appear to be in a single premeiotic stage, the 
idea of cell selection as an explanation of the dose-rate effect was less satisfactory than a hypothesis of repair of a 
premutational state induced by radiation at low dose rates.

<P>To investigate further the low mutation rate at 1,000 R, Russell (
<A HREF="#ref10-46">1963</A>) exposed samples of mice to total doses of 1,000 R of acute radiation in various fractions (
<a href="javascript:windowt1006 = window.open('../tables/table10-6.shtml', 'windowt1006', 'width=800,height=500,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt1006.focus()">Table 10-6</A>, 
row 25). The mutation rates obtained with some of the fractions fell near the line extrapolated from the 
0, 300, and 600 R points. Although the explanation is not clear, it appeared that some factor other than, or in addition to, cell selection 
must be operative. Finally, two doses of 500 R of acute radiation given one day apart yielded the highest mutation rate so far found in 
spermatogonia. This result suggests that the first dose imposes a synchronization and heightened mutability upon the cells and that the 
second dose thus yields more mutations than otherwise expected. Obviously this phenomenon requires further study by variation of the 
total doses, the sizes and numbers of the fractional doses, the intervals between the fractions, and the cell stage and type irradiated.

<P>Snell and Aebersold (
<A HREF="#ref10-60">1937</A>) first attempted to induce mutations in mice with neutrons and got evidence that neutrons are five to six times 
as effective as X-rays in inducing dominant lethals in spermatozoa. Snell (
<A HREF="#ref10-58">1939</A>) used the cross-backcross method of searching for recessive visible mutations but found none. Later studies by Batchelor <I>et al.</I> (
<A HREF="#ref10-2">1964</A>), Searle and Phillips (
<A HREF="#ref10-56">1964</A>) and Russell and Kelly (
<A HREF="#ref10-49">1964<I>a</I></A>, 
<A HREF="#ref10-50">1964<I>b</I></A>) have conformed the evidence that neutrons are five to six times more effective than X-rays for inducing 
mutations in premeiotic as well as postmeiotic stages. Batchelor <I>et al.</I> (
<A HREF="#ref10-2">1964</A>) found a mutation rate of 25.0 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP>/locus or about 110 x 10<SUP>-8</SUP>/rad/locus for spermatogonia 
exposed to 215 rads of neutrons with 100 R of &#947;-contamination at a rate of 0.002 rads/min or less (
<a href="javascript:windowt1007 = window.open('../tables/table10-7.shtml', 'windowt1007', 'width=800,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt1007.focus()">Table 10-7</A>, 
row 26). These authors suggested that high linear-energy-transfer radiation (neutrons) may have a 
dose-rate effect opposite in direction from that of low linear-energy-transfer radiation (X-rays). Russell and Kelly (
<A HREF="#ref10-50">1964<I>b</I></A>) did not find such an effect, however.

<P>Investigations of mutation rates in female germ cells have been less extensive. The rates for recessive visibles and lethals at 
seven specific loci in acutely irradiated fetal oogonia were about 10 to 14 x 10<SUP>-8</SUP>/R/locus, slightly more than one-half the spermatogonial rate (
<a href="javascript:windowt1008 = window.open('../tables/table10-8.shtml', 'windowt1008', 'width=800,height=500,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt1008.focus()">Table 10-8</A>, 
rows 28 and 29). The mutation rates in oogonia also turned out to be dependent upon the dose rate. When 500 R of X rays 
were given at a rate of 0.009 R/min, the specific locus rate was about 1.9 x 10<SUP>-8</SUP>/R/locus, whereas at 0.8 R/min it was 
12 x 10<SUP>-8</SUP>/R/locus, or about six times higher (
<a href="javascript:windowt1009 = window.open('../tables/table10-9.shtml', 'windowt1009', 'width=800,height=700,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt1009.focus()">Table 10-9</A>, 
row 31).

<P>The estimation of somatic mutation rates presents special technical problems, chief of which is that breeding tests of the presumed 
mutant cells are ruled out. Russell and Major (
<A HREF="#ref10-39">1957</A>) used the specific locus method (P-cross) to estimate the average mutation rate of four loci. C57BL females, mated 
with NB males, were irradiated on the 10.25 day of pregnancy. The zygotes should be

other than black anywhere in the coat may be taken to indicate a mutation at the

<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856114" target="_blank"><I>p</I></A> locus. 
This method gave a somatic rate of 70 x 10<SUP>-8</SUP>/R/locus for the same four loci exposed to the same amount of acute X-irradiation.

<P>The preceding discussion has referred only to estimates of rates of mutation to recessive visible and lethal mutations in spermatogonia, 
postspermatogonial cells, and oogonia, obtained in experiments using the specific locus method. The chief value of the specific locus method 
lies in its usefulness in comparing mutation rates in different cell stages under exposures to various types of radiation given at various 
rates and at various total doses. The method has relatively little value in predicting overall mutation rates, nor is any other method fully 
satisfactory for doing so. Estimates of mutation rates to dominant visibles and dominant lethals, as steps toward estimating overall mutation 
rates, are given for a variety of types of cells and of radiation in 
<a href="javascript:windowt1002 = window.open('../tables/table10-2.shtml', 'windowt1002', 'width=800,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt1002.focus()">Table 10-2</A> 
(row 3), 
<a href="javascript:windowt1004 = window.open('../tables/table10-4.shtml', 'windowt1004', 'width=800,height=1000,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt1004.focus()">Table 10-4</A> 
(rows 11 to 13) and 
<a href="javascript:windowt1008 = window.open('../tables/table10-8.shtml', 'windowt1008', 'width=800,height=500,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt1008.focus()">Table 10-8</A> 
(row 23). The estimates work out to 17.3 x 10<SUP>-8</SUP>/R/gamete for dominant visible mutations in spermatogonia 
exposed to acute X-rays and 16.7 x 10<SUP>-8</SUP>/R/gamete in oogonia. In contrast Sugahara (
<A HREF="#ref10-63">1964</A>) found a recessive lethal mutation rate of about 1.8 x 10<SUP>-4</SUP>/R/gamete, both using chromic &#947;-irradiation. 
It is apparent that many more studies need to be done before we shall have a clear understanding of the mutability of mouse genes exposed to radiation.

<P><B>Mutations at specific loci</B>

<P>There are several notable features of mutations induced at specific loci which are briefly mentioned here. Further information will be 
found in papers by Carter <I>et al.</I> (
<A HREF="#ref10-10">1958</A>), Russell and Russell (
<A HREF="#ref10-52">1959<I>b</I></A>), Phillips (
<A HREF="#ref10-34">1961</A>), L.B. Russell (
<A HREF="#ref10-38">1962</A>), and W.L. Russell (
<A HREF="#ref10-47">1965</A>).

<P>First, in spermatogonia the induced mutation rates show a 27-fold variation among the seven loci studied by the specific locus method. 
In post-spermatogonial stages, however, the rates are much more uniform (
<a href="javascript:windowt1010 = window.open('../tables/table10-10.shtml', 'windowt1010', 'width=800,height=300,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt1010.focus()">Table 10-10</A>). 
Second, mutations recovered from irradiated spermatogonia are mostly point mutations, whereas those from 
later stages contain a high proportion of chromosomal deficiencies. Specifically, only one deficiency at the closely linked 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856004" target="_blank"><I>d</I></A> and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856150" target="_blank"><I>se</I></A> loci was found in the irradiated spermatogonia, whereas five were found in later spermatogenic stages and six in oocytes. Third, 
about 75 per cent of the induced mutations are lethal when homozygous, lethals have occurred at all loci, and the time of death is 
frequently after birth. Fourth, in heterozygotes the induced mutations, although recessive by the usual criteria of their effects on 
pigmentation, frequently affect body size and viability.

<P>One question of considerable interest is not yet answerable. How do radiation-induced mutations in general compare, in the spectrum of 
phenotypic effects, with natural mutations? An answer to this question will require the same careful search for and analysis of spontaneous 
mutations that has been applied to radiation-induced mutations (
<A HREF="#ref10-21">Green <I>et al.</I>, 1965</A>). The fact that lethal mutations at the seven loci used in the specific locus studies were not 
known at the time the radiation studies were started may mean that natural mutations are less likely to be lethal when homozygous or it 
may mean that the existing mutations are the viable survivors out of a very much larger group containing many lethals. Until better 
information is available, we must withhold judgment about the comparability or noncomparability of induced and natural mutations in mice.

<P><B>EFFECTS IN POPULATIONS</B>

<P>The occurrence of radiation-induced mutations and chromosome aberrations implies that populations exposed to radiation will suffer 
deleterious effects. The magnitude of the effect following specified radiation exposures can only be predicted after we have more 
knowledge about the viability, fertility, and fecundity on nonirradiated descendants of irradiated ancestors. Several studies in 
which populations of mice or selected members thereof have been irradiated for one or more generations will be summarized in this 
section. For an introduction to the literature on other laboratory populations of mammals see Roderick (
<A HREF="#ref10-37">1964</A>).

<P>To understand the effects of ancestral irradiation on the genetic constitution of populations, it is necessary to control or 
deliberately vary the important variables: dose level and dose rate of irradiation, stage of germ cells irradiated, the sex irradiated, 
size of the breeding population, and genetic background of the population. The mouse is the only mammal for which a wide variety of genetically 
independent inbred strains and mutant-bearing stocks are available. The foundation populations of long-term experiments can be of wide variety, 
either hybrid or inbred, and each variety can be almost perfectly replicated genetically at another time or place.

<P>The pioneer work of Snell and Hertwig (see review by 
<A HREF="#ref10-42">Russell, 1954</A>) showed that the reduced number of animals born from irradiated postmeiotic germ cells of the sire was 
primarily due to dominant mutations of the chromosomal type. From these and subsequent studies it is apparent that dominant lethals 
and serious postnatal deleterious effects are easily detected among the zygotes formed from irradiated sperm and oocytes, but are 
comparatively very uncommon in the zygotes formed from irradiated spermatogonia. In female mammals premeiotic germ cells are not 
present after birth. In population studies, therefore, it is important to know the extent of the male's contribution to successive 
generations by irradiated sperm and by irradiated spermatogonia.

<P>The following discussion of experiments is arranged according to the germinal stage irradiated.

<P><B>Irradiation of postgonial stages</B>

<P>In a study Kalmus <I>et al.</I> (
<A HREF="#ref10-25">1952</A>) paired mice and allowed each pair to produce two litters. Then they X-rayed 
the gonads of males with 150 to 300 R and reconstituted the pairs. They found a reduction in litter size in the subsequent third litter 
compared to the second preirradiation litter. Also the sex ratio changed in the direction of expectation (fewer females among the offspring 
of irradiated males) in the third litter. The results are not clearly the consequence of irradiation because parity has effects on 
litter size and sex ratio.

<P>Spalding <I>et al.</I> (
<A HREF="#ref10-62">1964</A> and earlier) have reported an irradiation experiment of many generations. All the animals originated from a single pair 
of inbred RF mice. Two sublines were begun from the pair, one of which received no irradiation and functioned as a control line. The males 
of the other line were given 200 rads of whole-body X-rays at 24 to 28 days of age and mated to unexposed sisters in each generation. Throughout 
the experiment mice were conceived as early as 25 days and as late as 120 days after irradiation. The earliest animals conceived were probably 
used for the parents of following generations, since the sublines average about four generations each year. Therefore, the postspermatogonial 
germinal stages at the time of irradiation probably constitute most of the sires' genetic contribution to subsequent generations. Differences 
between the lines were observed in the sixth generation. The irradiated line was found to be significantly lower than the control in weaning 
weight, litter size at birth and weaning, and length of survival under protracted &#947;-ray and fractionated X-ray exposures. The irradiated 
line also exhibited a greater number of litters eaten by their mothers, but no consistent differences were observed in sex ratio, 
weaned-to-born ratio, or lifespan.

<P>In their 1964 study they also showed values of some of these characteristics for a third line, an irradiated subline derived from the 
irradiated line but propagated in parallel for a few generations without irradiation. In those traits showing significant differences between 
irradiated and control lines, the values for the irradiated subline were not intermediate; sometimes the values fell beyond those of the 
control and sometimes beyond those of the irradiated line. One would expect the irradiated subline to be intermediate or at least consistently 
nearer one line or the other if the differences between the irradiated and control lines were due solely to the amount of ancestral irradiation.

<P>Russell (
<A HREF="#ref10-44">1957</A>) investigated the lifespan of offspring of (101 x C3H)F<SUB>1</SUB> males exposed to neutrons from a nuclear detonation. 
The range of exposure was 0 to 186 rep, and the offspring were conceived in the presterile period. A general life shortening of 0.61 days for 
each rep was calculated from the data over the entire range of doses. There was no evidence of nonlinearity of this mortality over the dose range.

<P>In a similar study Spalding (
<A HREF="#ref10-61">1964</A>) investigated the lifespan of male RF mice exposed to both fission neutrons and &#947;-rays and the lifespan of their first 
and second generation offspring. He exposed five groups of males to various doses of whole-body fission neutrons ranging from 32 to 117 rads 
and another group to whole-body Co<SUP>60</SUP> &#947;-rays over a range of 60 to 300 rads. A third major group, a control population of males, 
received no irradiation. To obtain offspring from both pre- and postspermatogonial stages during the time of irradiation, he mated the males 
immediately after irradiation and also 16 weeks after irradiation to two different samples of RF females. He was unable to demonstrate any 
shortening of the life or any effect on the sex ratio.

<P>Proshina (
<A HREF="#ref10-36">1961</A>) studied the fitness of nonpedigreed white mice over five generations after a series of graded doses, 50 to 300 R of X-rays, 
were given to 400 males of the initial generation. We do not know the time between irradiation and mating of the animals nor the germinal stage 
irradiated. She found more deaths in the first month of life in the descendants of the irradiated males than in the control group. This effect 
was apparent in all five generations. The weights of 1-month-old mice were also less than in the controls in all generations, and developmental 
anomalies were noted in the descendants of the irradiated males in the first two generations.

<P>From the summary of the experiment of Lindop and Rotblat (
<A HREF="#ref10-28">1963</A>), it is not clear what stages of spermatogenesis at the time of irradiation contributed to subsequent generations. Offspring 
from male mice irradiated with a whole-body dose of 350 R of X-rays at 4 weeks of age were compared with offspring of nonirradiated males. They 
found no effect of three generations of such parental exposure on lifespan or radiation sensitivity.

<P><B>Continuous irradiation exposure</B>

<P>In some studies, populations of mice were either left continuously in a radiation field or males were periodically removed for irradiation and 
then replaced with their nonirradiated mates. Fertilizing gametes, therefore, could come from all possible stages of gametogenesis at the time of 
irradiation.

<P>The early studies of Charles <I>et al.</I> (reported in 
<A HREF="#ref10-13">1960</A> and 
<A HREF="#ref10-15">1961</A>) were on males of strain DBA exposed to radiation of the gonads and mated to nonirradiated females of strain C57BL. The gonadal 
doses were 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 10 R/day of X-rays given in a period of 1 to 1.5 hours each day except Sunday. The males remained with the females 
throughout the period except for the short time each day necessary for the irradiation. Therefore, part and probably most of the fertilizing sperm 
were irradiated in postspermatogonial stages. Charles <I>et al.</I> found increased juvenile mortality in the offspring of the males receiving 
10 R/day or those receiving a total dose of 100 R or more. The effect was significantly expressed in larger litters but only suggestive in smaller 
litters. These investigators thoroughly autopsied all of the male offspring of the irradiated and control sires. Examining mice in such detail in 
a radiation-genetics experiment has never been attempted elsewhere. They observed a small but significant increase in rare external and internal 
morphological abnormalities among the offspring of the irradiated males. The female offspring were mated to an albino tester stock for the analysis 
of partial sterility. There were a greater number of partially sterile females whose fathers had been irradiated. About one-fifth of these females 
were tested for another generation and proved to be semisterile; that is, their partial sterility could be explained as a consequence of a reciprocal 
translocation induced by irradiation (
<A HREF="chapter7.shtml">Chapter 7</A>).

<P>Charles <I>et al.</I> were unable to find any differences between the groups in sex ratio at weaning. In the male offspring of the irradiated 
and control sires they found no differences in body weight, tail length, body length, strength, and number of Peyer's patches on the small intestines. 
In the female offspring they found no difference in age at time of their fourth litters nor in total offspring born in their first four litters.

<P>In a long-term investigation Gowen and Stadler (
<A HREF="#ref10-18">1964</A> and earlier) studied the fitness of 10 inbred strains exposed to continuous Co<SUP>60</SUP> &#947;-rays over many generations. 
They exposed mice to doses ranging from 0.06 to 0.10 R/hour given during 22-hour days. Throughout the study the strains were propagated by 
brother-sister matings. Mice receiving 3.0 R or more per day were sterile. Five strains did not survive five generations, and the other five 
survived 12 generations. At least one strain reached the 24th generation. Gowen and Stadler believed that irradiation probably was not a 
significant factor in extinguishing the five lines because these strains were less vigorous at the outset of the experiment. The surviving 
strains appeared healthy and did not appear to differ from their respective nonirradiated controls in first-litter productivity or in sex ratio. 
Lifespan data were collected on all the surviving strains over all the generations and analyzed through the sixth generation. Although there was 
a significant decline in lifespan with succeeding generations, the authors said the decline could not be explained as a result of the increased 
number of generations of ancestral irradiation. The average correlation of lifespan and ancestral irradiation within strains and within generations 
was -0.17. These correlations differed between strains but not between generations.

<P>In another long-term experiment Touchberry and Verley (
<A HREF="#ref10-64">1964</A>) studied the effects of whole-body  X-rays given for successive generations to several hybrid populations derived from 
B6DF<SUB>1</SUB>/J and several inbred populations derived from C57BL/6J. Males of the initial populations were divided into five groups and 
given 0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 R, respectively. In the next generation, matings were made at random between the irradiated groups within the inbred 
or within the hybrid populations. Mice were between 60 and 85 days old at the time of irradiation and were mated 14 days after irradiation. They were 
permitted to raise two litters, from which parents of the subsequent generation were chosen randomly.

<P>Data on six generations of the hybrid populations and four generations of the inbred populations were used for the analysis. In both the inbred 
and hybrid populations they found a decrease in litter size with an increase in parental irradiation. Surprisingly they also found an increase in 
32-day body weight and in growth rate from 2 to 38 days with an increase in parental irradiation. Touchberry and Verley believed the decrease in 
litter size to be evidence of induced dominant mutations and the increase in 32-day body weight and growth rate to be evidence of heterotic effects 
of the induced mutations. They pointed out that maternal irradiation produced both genetic and somatic effects, whereas paternal irradiation produced 
genetic effects only. The supposition of a heterotic effect seems less probable than the possibility that 32-day weight and growth rate are negatively 
correlated with and partially dependent upon litter size.

<P>Sugahara (
<A HREF="#ref10-63">1964</A>) and his colleagues raised and bred two populations of a tester stock of mice for three generations in a field of 
Co<SUP>60</SUP> &#947;-rays. In the first experiment the mice were given about 5 to 8 R/22-hour day and in the second experiment 0.43 R/22-hour day. 
In a third experiment they gave acute doses of 600 R of X-rays to the gonads of males of another population of the same stock. In a fourth experiment 
they irradiated the adult males of one generation with 597.3 R of Co<SUP>60</SUP> &#947;-rays given at a dose rate of 9.3 R/22-hour day. Nonirradiated 
but genetically similar mice were raised and maintained in a similar manner to serve as control populations. The fourth generation in the first two 
experiments and the second generation in the third and fourth experiments, all nonirradiated, were crossed to strain CBA, according to Haldane's (
<A HREF="#ref10-23">1956</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref10-24">1957</A>) plan. From the F<SUB>1</SUB> population, siblings were intercrossed to produce an F<SUB>2</SUB> generation. In addition to the 
data on suspected lethals induced in these populations (mentioned in the first part of this chapter), they collected data on mean litter size, 
incidence of sterile pairs, sex ratio, and juvenile death (death before weaning). Only for juvenile death was there a clear effect of ancestral 
irradiation in the second, third, and fourth experiments. This effect was found in the F<SUB>1</SUB> and F<SUB>2</SUB> generations following the outcross.

<P>To determine whether irradiation would produce subline differentiation Searle (
<A HREF="#ref10-54">1964<I>a</I></A>) studied the effect of continuous Co<SUP>60</SUP> &#947;-rays on 28 pairs of sublines of the inbred strain C3H/HeH. 
One subline of each pair was exposed to 1R/night with a total dose of about 80 R/generation, whereas the other subline was set aside as a nonirradiated 
control. All sublines were propagated by brother-sister matings. Data on fitness characteristics were analyzed through 24 generations. Searle found a 
significant reduction in litter size in the irradiated sublines particularly apparent with greater parity, but he attributed the effect to damage of 
irradiated somatic tissue and not to mutations in irradiated ancestral germ plasm. No differences were found between the irradiated and control lines 
in complete sterility. Searle studied the genetic divergence of two pairs of sublines by comparing the lines with respect to 23 quasi-continuous 
characteristics and four metrical characters of the skeletal system. The unexpected result was that the rate of divergence was somewhat greater for the 
nonirradiated lines than for the irradiated lines.

<P><B>Irradiation of spermatogonia</B>

<P>Dominant mutations or chromosomal aberrations can be induced by irradiating spermatogonia, and occasionally such changes 
do reach zygotes and are passed on to subsequent generations (
<A HREF="#ref10-22">Griffen, 1964</A>; 
<A HREF="#ref10-32">Lyon <I>et al.</I>, 1964</A>). However, they are far fewer than can be found among zygotes descended from irradiated postspermatogonial 
stages. There is apparently no period after irradiation when the germ line can be assumed to be free from any kind of genetic damage. Irradiation 
will apparently have some effect on the fitness of populations, no matter what stage of gametogenesis is irradiated. The problem still remains, 
however, to show clearly in what ways <I>population fitness</I> is damaged by irradiating spermatogonia. The effect of spermatogonial irradiation on 
population fitness is important, too, because it is this type of irradiation damage which may be most important to a human population.

<P>Ehling and Randolph (
<A HREF="#ref10-16">1962</A>) reported an experiment in which strain 101 males were exposed to different sources and conditions of radiation and then crossed 
to C3H females so that both postspermatogonial and spermatogonial stages could be studied independently with respect to their effects on skeletal 
abnormalities in the F<SUB>1</SUB> animals. The progeny were conceived during the presterile period after their fathers were irradiated with 600 rads 
of X-rays or 80 to 200 rads of neutrons with varying intensities. Males mated after the poststerile period had received 600 rads. The litters from 
the exposed sires were killed for examination between 26 and 28 days of age. Skeletons of 618 offspring from nonirradiated sires and 515 offspring 
of irradiated sires were examined. The authors classified the abnormalities as either of two types depending upon their frequency: class I abnormalities 
were those occurring only once in all the animals studied, and class II abnormalities were those occurring more than once. No differences between 
irradiated and control groups were found in frequencies of class II abnormalities, nor in class I abnormalities when progeny were derived from irradiated 
spermatogonial cells. A significant difference, however, was discovered between the irradiated and control groups in class I abnormalities when the 
sires' contribution was derived from irradiated postgonial cells. The authors concluded that class I abnormalities were probably due to genetic effects 
and class I to nongenetic effects.

<P>In studies of general fitness Kohn (
<A HREF="#ref10-26">1960</A>) irradiated CAF<SUB>1</SUB> males with X-rays over a range of 0 to 720 rads. During the poststerile period surviving males were 
mated to nonirradiated BALB/cCrgl females and the offspring were studied for the characteristics: males per litter, females per litter, progeny per 
litter, sex ratio at birth, and sex ratio at weaning. Regression lines were fitted to these characteristics plotted against the sires' irradiation 
doses, but the slopes were not significant. Thus no effect of irradiation was demonstrated. Samples of the progeny were also studied for lifespan and 
tolerance to 500 rads of X-rays per week, but no significant effect of paternal irradiation was observed (
<A HREF="#ref10-27">Kohn <I>et al.</I>, 1965</A>).

<P>However, Russell and Russell (
<A HREF="#ref10-51">1959<I>a</I></A>) reported a reduction of mean litter size at 3 weeks of age among offspring derived from spermatogonia given 300 R of 
X-rays in a single generation. The lower mean litter size at 3 weeks was consistently found in all 10 groups of animals studied over different periods of time.

<P>In further studies of fertility Carter and Lyon (
<A HREF="#ref10-8">1961</A>) gave 600 R of whole-body X-irradiation to (101 x C3H)F<SUB>1</SUB> males. 
The males were mated 6 weeks after irradiation to females of the same F<SUB>1</SUB>. The females were allowed to bear four litters and were then 
dissected during their fifth pregnancies for counts of corpora lutea, moles, and live and dead fetuses. The males from the liveborn litters were 
crossbred to detect a possible reduction of their fertility, and their mates were dissected during their pregnancies for similar counts. The same 
males were then mated to females of strain 101 to produce offspring to be backcrossed to the males to get an indication of the induction of recessive 
lethals and visibles. There was no evidence of reduced fertility in the F<SUB>1</SUB> males. There was also no difference found in litter size at 
birth when the F<SUB>1</SUB> males were crossed to strain 101 females. Nor was there any difference in the counts of corpora lutea, number of implantations, 
moles, or live or dead embryos. But from backcross matings the granddaughters of the irradiated males had a significant reduction of corpora lutea per 
pregnancy over that in the control granddaughters, <I>but</I> no differences were found in number born per litter. The authors concluded that there is 
a compensating mechanism tending to equalize the litter sizes despite differences in the number of eggs ovulated.

<P>Later experiments at Harwell have considerably clarified the mechanisms involved in reduced fertility following spermatogonial irradiation. Lyon <I>et al.</I> (
<A HREF="#ref10-32">1964</A>) irradiated the males of a cross of strains C3H/HeH and 101/H with an acute gonadal dose of 1,200 R of X-rays in two fractions 8 
weeks apart. Twelve weeks after the latter dose, the F<SUB>1</SUB> males were outcrossed to CBA/H females. Controls were propagated and manipulated 
in the same manner but with no irradiation. The sizes of the litters of the irradiated sires were reduced 15 per cent at birth. The decrease in litter 
size was mostly due to increased embryonic death just after implantation. Part of this lethality was due to semisterility caused by the induction of 
reciprocal translocations at a rate of 3.3 per cent per gamete. Subsequent crosses also revealed a higher incidence of recessive lethal mutations induced 
in the irradiated group. No differences were found in sex ratios.

<P>In the same experiment Searle (
<A HREF="#ref10-55">1964<I>b</I></A>) outcrossed the F<SUB>1</SUB> daughters and recorded the sizes of their first four litters. Their fifth litters were observed 
at the 14-day fetal stage. The mean litter size was 5.5 per cent lower in the daughters of the irradiated males. This reduction in fertility was almost 
wholly attributable to semisterility, present in 6.7 per cent of the daughters of the irradiated males. Searle estimated the rate of induction of 
translocations in spermatogonia to be 6.4 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP>/R/genome. This rate is about one-sixth that of spermatozoa; he suggested that spermatogonial 
stages are less sensitive to irradiation.

<P>In a related study, Philips and Searle (
<A HREF="#ref10-35">1964</A>) looked for a dose-rate effect by spreading the 1,200 R over 12 weeks at 100 R/week. The lethal effect was reduced to a 2 per cent 
decrease in litter size, and the rate of induction of translocations to about 1 per cent. Neither of these effects was significant when compared with 
the control values, but the fact that they were far less than the effects observed after an acute dose of 1,200 R is evidence for a dose-rate effect.

<P>In long-term studies L&#252;ning and Sheridan (
<A HREF="#ref10-30">1964</A> and earlier) irradiated the spermatogonia of males of a randomly mated population from strain CBA with 276 R of X-rays each 
generation and compared their descendants with those of a parallel nonirradiated control population. The radiation was delivered to the gonads of 
the males with the rest of the body shielded. In studying the reproductive performance of the fourth to sixth generations under irradiation, they 
found a consistent reduction of litter size in the irradiated group independent of the number of litters the females produced. The females of the 
irradiated group had a slightly greater frequency of losses of complete litters. L&#252;ning and Sheridan also found a decrease in the number of 
corpora lutea in the first litters of the fourth generation in the irradiated group. These findings suggested that damage to this population is 
through a lowered maternal fitness. There was no change in the sex ratio because of irradiation. Further studies of offspring of sib and nonsib matings 
of these lines indicated that the major dominant effects of irradiation were on the immediate offspring of the irradiated males and not on future 
generations. In other words, there was no evidence that dominant detrimental effects accumulated with increasing generations of irradiation. However 
recessive lethals apparently did accumulate with successive generations of irradiation.

<P>In other long-term studies Green and his colleague (
<A HREF="#ref10-20">Green, <I>et al.</I>, 1964</A>; Roderick and Schlager, 1965, personal communication) propagated both genetically heterogeneous and genetically 
homogeneous populations of mice under different levels of irradiation for several generations. The genetically heterogeneous populations were all descended 
from a 4-way cross of genetically independent inbred strains. The genetically homogeneous populations were all descended from a single pair of mice 
from strain C57BL/10Gn. The two major populations were subdivided at the outset of the experiment into several different subpopulations and propagated in 
parallel with different amounts of inbreeding in order to study the possible effect of inbreeding in combination with the effect of irradiation. All 
groups were further subdivided so that different levels of irradiation could be delivered to populations of each breeding size. Irradiation doses were 
0, 50, and 100 R per generation. In the data collected from the mice in the first and second litters used to propagate the main lines, no differences 
were found in age of dam at parturition, number born, number weaned, sex ratio, weaned-to-born ratio, or frequency of phenotypic deviations attributable 
to differences in irradiation dose or breeding size of the population.

<P>Samples of nonirradiated males from the 11th generation were mated to siblings as well as to females from strain C57BL/6J for a study of prenatal 
mortality. The females were dissected before parturition, and data were taken on number of corpora lutea, moles, dead fetuses, and living fetuses. No 
differences in prenatal mortality between the populations were found which could be attributed to ancestral radiation or inbreeding level.

<P>Every three generations some nonirradiated animals of each dose and breeding size group were set aside to determine their lifespan reproductive performance. 
In these studies a significant reduction in number of litters was found in the genetically homogeneous populations after nine generations, and this difference 
could be attributed to the ancestral radiation exposure. The mean litter sizes, however, did not differ. These findings suggested that the animals with ancestral 
irradiation perform just as well through most of their lives, but that they deteriorate sooner physiologically. The authors point out the value of studies of 
lifetime performance, because these differences would not have been observed on data of first and second litters only. The effect was <I>not</I> observed in 
the heterogeneous populations after nine generations, and no effects could be attributed to the inbreeding levels of the subpopulations.

<P>Green and Les (
<A HREF="#ref10-19">1964</A>) tried to bring about genetic extinction in a small hybrid mouse population by irradiating the spermatogonia (body shielded) with 
a dose of 900 R of X-rays in each generation. After nine generations they found no differences in fertility, number of litters, number of offspring 
born and weaned, and average litter size between the irradiated and nonirradiated control populations. It is not clear why this study and that of Kohn (
<A HREF="#ref10-26">1960</A>) failed to show the reduced litter size reported in other studies with comparable radiation doses.

<P><B>Conclusions</B>

<P>
<a href="javascript:windowt1011 = window.open('../tables/table10-11.shtml', 'windowt1011', 'width=800,height=1000,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt1011.focus()">Table 10-11</A> 
gives an abridged summary of the methods and results of the papers discussed in this section of the chapter. Characteristics such 
as viability and fertility are the principal components of population fitness. It appears that reduction in fitness of mouse populations as measured in these 
characteristics can be shown to be a result of irradiation of doses as low as 100 to 300 R per generation. Furthermore, the data suggest that decreased fitness, 
like chromosome abnormalities, can be more easily brought about and the damage more easily passed on to subsequent generation as a result of postspermatogonial 
irradiation than of spermatogonial irradiation. Genetically heterogeneous populations of mice may be more resistant than inbred populations to radiation-induced 
damage to fitness. Selection probably eliminates many mutations in each generation and thus reduces the damage to population fitness. There may be mechanisms of 
physiological compensation, such as that reported by Carter and Lyon (
<A HREF="#ref10-8">1961</A>), ameliorating the outward phenotypic manifestations of a fitness decrement. Certain fitness traits seem to express the genetic damage from 
irradiation better than others in different experimental designs and under different conditions. Sex ratios apparently do not change in mouse populations under 
the irradiation and conditions studied, even though it is the only characteristic which showed an apparent change after irradiation of a human population (
<A HREF="#ref10-33">Neel, 1963</A>).

<P><B>SUMMARY</B>
</CENTER>

<P>Several experiments, chiefly at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and at the MRC Radiobiological Research Unit at Harwell, have yielded estimates 
of induced mutation rates in various types of germinal cells of mice exposed to X-rays, &#947;-rays, and neutrons. These experiments have revealed 
that mutation rates depend on many factors including: sex and cell stage irradiated, type of mutation scored, genotype or strain, and kind, amount, 
and dose of radiation.

<P>A number of other experiments have been initiated by the desire to predict the effect of irradiating one or more generations on the fitness of a 
population. Measures of fitness include fertility, numbers and sizes of litters, reproductive life, and lifespan. No clear generalization emerges 
from the experiments so far reported, except that irradiation of postgonial stages appears to be more detrimental to fitness than irradiation of 
gonial stages. This does not necessarily mean that gonial stages are less sensitive to radiation damage; possibly the damage is compensated by 
selection in favor of nonmutated cells.
