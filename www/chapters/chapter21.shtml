<H3>H. Glenn Wolfe and Douglas L. Coleman</H3>

<P>Much has been written about phenogenesis of pigment in the mouse. Pigmentation of mice with part or major emphasis on genetic aspects is reviewed by Gr&#252;neberg (
<A HREF="#ref21-35">1952</A>) and Deol (
<A HREF="#ref21-20">1963</A>), of rodents and carnivores by Little (
<A HREF="#ref21-46">1958</A>), and of mammals in general by Chase and Mann (
<A HREF="#ref21-10">1960</A>), Billingham and Silvers (
<A HREF="#ref21-2">1960</A>), and Silvers (
<A HREF="#ref21-97">1961</A>).

<P>Methodology in pigment cell research in mammals has been discussed by Silvers (
<A HREF="#ref21-98">1963</A>). The approaches to the general problem of pigmentation aside from conventional microscopic methods have involved a detailed comparison of the 
various genetically influenced types of pigment with respect to (1) the actual amount and distribution of the pigment as measured colorimetrically and histologically, 
(2) the amount of pigment-forming enzymes present, <I>e.g.</I>, tyrosinase as measured enzymatically, and (3) the size, shape, and distribution of the developing pigment 
granules as seen with the electron microscope. The same techniques have been applied to potentially pigmented tissue or pigmented tissues transplanted to mice of other 
genotypes or to chick coelom and more recently to skin explants cultured <I>in vitro</I>.

<P>It is rather obvious that pigment differences were studied early because they are conspicuous and are convenient and easy to classify in genetic experiments. At the 
same time pigment differences in mice or other mammals provide an excellent way to study a single cell type that is more or less autonomous, being little affected by 
surrounding tissues. Investigators in the field of mammalian genetics will recognize this as a rare attribute.

<P><B>DIFFERENCES IN PIGMENTATION UNDER SINGLE GENE CONTROL</B>

<P>For convenience and as an aid to later discussion, some of the "pigment genes" of the mouse and their principal effects are listed in 
<a href="javascript:windowt2101 = window.open('../tables/table21-1.shtml', 'windowt2101', 'width=1000,height=1000,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt2101.focus()">Table 21-1</A>. 
We have attempted to classify these genes as to probable site of gene action. For some the experimental evidence is good, whereas for others 
the classification is based largely on inference from observed effects.

<P>Pigment genes may affect kind or intensity of coat color or affect the distribution of pigment over the integument of the mouse, <I>i.e.</I>, cause white 
spotting or variegation (mottling). Several affect both color and spotting, <I>e.g.</I>, white (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856088" target="_blank"><I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I></A>) (
<a href="javascript:windowf2102c = window.open('../figures/figure21-2C.shtml', 'windowf2102c', 'width=500,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf2102c.focus()">Figure 21-<I>2C</I></A>), 
and many affect or are affected by other physiological systems (are pleiotropic). Sterility, anemia, choreic behavior, anomalies 
of the axial skeleton, failure of secondary bone resorption, reduced eye size, megacolon, and lethality are frequently associated with reduced eye and coat color, 
white spotting, and mottling. The most pronounced of these related effects are mentioned in 
<a href="javascript:windowt2101 = window.open('../tables/table21-1.shtml', 'windowt2101', 'width=1000,height=1000,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt2101.focus()">Table 21-1</A>. 
The listing of a gene is not intended to mean that its primary effect is on pigment or pigment distribution. For example, restriction of 
pigment caused by 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856232" target="_blank"><I>W</I></A>- or 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:96974" target="_blank"><I>Sl</I></A>-series alleles (Figures 
<a href="javascript:windowf2102d = window.open('../figures/figure21-2D.shtml', 'windowf2102d', 'width=500,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf2102d.focus()">21-2<I>D</I></A>, 
<a href="javascript:windowf2102e = window.open('../figures/figure21-2E.shtml', 'windowf2102e', 'width=500,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf2102e.focus()">21-2<I>E</I></A>) 
is generally considered secondary to more fundamental metabolic disturbances (
<A HREF="chapter17.shtml">Chapter 17</A>). The reader is referred to theoretical discussions of pleiotropism by Goldschmidt (
<A HREF="#ref21-34">1958</A>), Hadorn (
<A HREF="#ref21-38">1961</A>), and Gr&#252;neberg (
<A HREF="#ref21-36">1963</A>).

<P>The inheritance of coat color in mice, including spotting patterns, is not a new concern of geneticists. Indeed albinism (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855976" target="_blank"><I>c</I></A>) (
<a href="javascript:windowf2102a = window.open('../figures/figure21-2A.shtml', 'windowf2102a', 'width=500,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf2102a.focus()">Figure 21-<I>2A</I></A>) 
in mice was the first to be analyzed in mammals by means of the newly rediscovered principles of Mendel (
<A HREF="#ref21-17">Cu&#233;not, 1902</A>; 
<A HREF="#ref21-4">Castle and Allen, 1903</A>). The acquisition and analysis of mutant genes yellow (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856798" target="_blank"><I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I></A>), white bellied agouti (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855936" target="_blank"><I>A<SUP>w</SUP></I></A>), nonagouti (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855937" target="_blank"><I>a</I></A>), dilute (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856004" target="_blank"><I>d</I></A>), brown (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855960" target="_blank"><I>b</I></A>, dominant spotting (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856232" target="_blank"><I>W</I></A>), pink-eyed dilution (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:97454" target="_blank"><I>p</I></A>), and piebald spotting (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856148" target="_blank"><I>s</I></A>) 
soon followed until today some 70 genes are known affecting color or spotting at about 40 loci (see Figures 
<a href="javascript:windowf2101 = window.open('../figures/figure21-1.shtml', 'windowf2101', 'width=1000,height=1100,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf2101.focus()">21-1</A>, 
<a href="javascript:windowf2102 = window.open('../figures/figure21-2.shtml', 'windowf2102', 'width=1000,height=1100,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf2102.focus()">21-2</A> 
for coat colors of mice). Interesting accounts of early genetic studies of pigmentation in mice may be found in Little (
<A HREF="#ref21-45">1913</A>) and Wright (
<A HREF="#ref21-108">1917</A>).

<P><B>PIGMENT CELLS: ORIGIN, LOCATION, AND FUNCTION IN ADULT STRUCTURES</B>

<P>All pigment in the mouse is in the form of granules (or modified granules) produced by a specialized cell, the melanocyte. This pigment may be either of two basic kinds, 
eumelanin (black or brown) and phaeomelanin (yellow). Melanocytes in a single hair follicle that are producing eumelanin and phaeomelanin (both kinds of pigment may be 
present within a single melanocyte) are illustrated in 
<a href="javascript:windowf2103 = window.open('../figures/figure21-3.shtml', 'windowf2103', 'width=900,height=750,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf2103.focus()">Figure 21-3</A>. 
All prospective pigment cells, or melanoblasts, except those of the retinal pigment epithelium (which come from the outer wall of the optic cup) 
arise from cells of the neural crest (Rawles, 
<A HREF="#ref21-69">1940</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref21-70">1947</A> and reviews by Rawles, 
<A HREF="#ref21-71">1948</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref21-72">1953</A>). These melanoblasts migrate mediolaterally from the neural crest during the 8th to 12th day of fetal development to their defined locations, in the 
usual case to the hair bulb matrix of the receiving hair follicle (Rawles, 
<A HREF="#ref21-69">1940</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref21-70">1947</A>). In an undifferentiated state melanoblasts cannot be distinguished by any known criterion from the other embryonic cells in which they are associated. 
The experimental procedure used by Rawles (
<A HREF="#ref21-70">1947</A>) to prove the neural crest origin of pigment cells in the mouse was to isolate tissues from various axial levels at timed developmental stages and 
transplant them to the embryonic coelom of White Leghorn chick hosts. Only those tissues containing presumptive neural crest, either histologically recognizable neural crest 
or cells migrating from the neural crest, produced melanocytes (
<A HREF="#ref21-70">Rawles, 1947</A>).

<P>Some investigators have used the silver nitrate staining reaction to chart the migration of melanoblasts in time fetuses of mice (
<A HREF="#ref21-18">Danneel and Cleffmann, 1954</A>; 
<A HREF="#ref21-87">Schumann, 1960</A>; 
<A HREF="#ref21-19">Danneel and Schumann, 1961</A>). However, a serious limitation of the method is that melanoblasts apparently are not stainable upon arrival in a region. Schumann (
<A HREF="#ref21-87">1960</A>) first detected pigment cells in the dermis near the ear primordium in 13-day fetuses of the C57 strain and in limb buds on day 17. Transplant data by Rawles (
<A HREF="#ref21-70">1947</A>) dictate dispersal of melanoblasts by day 12 to all regions of the fetus with the possible exception of extremities. This is further corroborated by Mayer and Reams (
<A HREF="#ref21-55">1962</A>), who traced the migration of melanoblasts into connective tissue of leg musculature by transplants of fetal leg muscle of PET/LSU mice of differing ages to chick coelom. 
Melanoblasts reach the dorsal surface of the leg by day 12 and migrate via the dermal-epidermal interface into the interior mesoderm by the end of day 14.

<P>Indirect information about early behavior and number of melanoblasts has come from studies of X-ray-induced mosaics by Russell and Major (
<A HREF="#ref21-82">1957</A>). By extrapolation from the size of mutant color spots in adults developed from fetuses irradiated at 10&#188; days they estimated the modal 
number of prospective pigment cells to be from 150 to 200 at this stage of development. Melanocytes are not normally found in trunk-skin epidermis except in 
association with the hair bulb. They are, however, present in the basal layer of the epidermis and dermis of tail, feet, nose, ear, scrotum, genital papilla, 
and eyelids as well as meninges of the brain, particularly between the olfactory and cerebral hemispheres, in the parathyroid, thymus, and harderian gland, and in the nictitans and choroid (
<A HREF="#ref21-50">Markert and Silvers, 1956</A>). Melanocytes are also found in ovary and spleen (
<A HREF="#ref21-2">Billingham and Silvers, 1960</A>) and are nearly ubiquitous in distribution in connective tissue of PET/MCV mice (now extinct), being consistently 
absent only from the connective tissue of the gut mucosa (
<A HREF="#ref21-61">Nichols and Reams, 1960</A>). Melanocytes were particularly abundant in connective tissue of lungs, kidney, rib cartilages, gonads, intercostal and extremity muscles, 
and semicircular canals of PET/MCV mice.

<P>The dendritic or branched melanocytes of neural crest origin function in the epidermis as unicellular melanin-secreting glands (
<A HREF="#ref21-2">Billingham and Silvers, 1960</A>). Because the function of melanocytes is so intimately connected with the hair follicle the growth and differentiation of hair 
follicles and hair will be briefly discussed.

<P>Development of the hair follicle is initiated in the mouse embryo in the period extending from about 7 days before birth to 4 or more days after birth (
<A HREF="#ref21-8">Chase, 1954</A>). Vibrissa follicles develop first, followed by the larger coat hairs, then the smaller ones. The hair follicle forms as a solid cylindrical downgrowth 
of cells that includes melanoblasts from the basal layer of the epidermis. The stages of hair growth are <I>anagen</I>, growing phase (six substages of 17 days duration); 
<I>catagen</I>, the transitional phase (2 days duration); and <I>telogen</I>, the resting phase (of variable duration until the next hair cycle) (
<A HREF="#ref21-23">Dry, 1926</A>; 
<A HREF="#ref21-12">Chase <I>et al.</I>, 1951</A>). Pigment cells normally first develop melanin during anagen III. Melanization and hair growth are maximal during anagen VI. 
Melanin granules are deposited, presumably through the end processes of dendritic melanocytes by a kind of cytocrine activity, into the cortical and medullary cells of the growing 
hair as they are pushed through the outer cone of pigment cells of the hair bulb matrix.

<P>Each new hair passes through the same growth phases and acquires its own complement of melanocytes. The source of melanocytes for succeeding hair generations is 
not known but it could be from (1) mitotic descendants of melanocytes or reactivated melanocytes, (2) a "papilla reservoir" of melanoblasts or from melanoblasts that 
migrate into the papilla from dermal tissues, or (3) undifferentiated stem cells in the vicinity of the hair follicle. The hair follicle and its relation to pigment 
cells is discussed in reviews by Chase (
<A HREF="#ref21-8">1954</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref21-9">1958</A>) and Chase and Mann (
<A HREF="#ref21-10">1960</A>).

<P>The developing hair very early becomes keratinized and may become any one of four principal types making up the coat of the mouse: monotrich, awl, auchene, or zigzag (
<A HREF="#ref21-23">Dry, 1926</A>; see 
<A HREF="chapter13.shtml">Chapter 13</A> for anatomy of skin and its derivatives). A number of mutations in the mouse deter development of the hair follicle or alter the normal distribution 
or proportions of hair types which in turn indirectly affects coat color (
<A HREF="chapter8.shtml">Chapter 8</A>). The mutant Tabby (<I>Ta</I>) is an example. A good discussion of some hair and pigment mutants, with emphasis on follicle development, 
may be found in Chase and Mann (
<A HREF="#ref21-10">1960</A>).

<P>The hair of the mouse is an accurate chronometer of events occurring within the melanocyte and of interaction between the melanocyte and the hair follicle. A history of pigment 
production by the melanocytes is contained within the hair bulb matrix. Russell (
<A HREF="#ref21-76">1946</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref21-77">1948</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref21-78">1949<I>a</I></A>, 
<A HREF="#ref21-79">1949<I>b</I></A>) utilized this fact in studies of hair pigment granules and pigment volume in mice of 36 different genotypes. Number, size, shape, clumping, 
and arrangement of granules within medullary cells and along the hair shaft and type of pigment produced were each found to contribute in an important way to the final coat color expressed (
<A HREF="#ref21-76">Russell, 1946</A>). Some important generalizations emerging from the study are: (1) The alleles at the agouti locus (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856798" target="_blank"><I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I></A>, 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855936" target="_blank"><I>A<SUP>w</SUP></I></A>, 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855937" target="_blank"><I>a</I></A>) 
control a reversible trigger mechanism causing either yellow or black pigment granules to be deposited in the hair, (2) the principal effect of substituting brown (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855960" target="_blank"><I>b</I></A>) 
for black (+) is a qualitative change in pigment from black to brown with some reduction in pigment volume, (3) the alleles at the albino locus (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855977" target="_blank"><I>c<SUP>ch</SUP></I></A>, 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855978" target="_blank"><I>c<SUP>e</SUP></I></A>, 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855976" target="_blank"><I>c</I></A>) 
appear to control quantity of pigment only, (4) the dilute allele (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856004" target="_blank"><I>d</I></A>) 
causes irregularity of pigment deposition (granular clumping), reduced cortical pigment, and uneven pigment distribution within the cells of the hair, and (5) pink-eyed dilution (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:97454" target="_blank"><I>p</I></A>) 
affects size of granules and levels of pigmentation. These shred-like granules assume a kind of flocculent clumping and hairs have greatly reduced pigmentation distally (
<A HREF="#ref21-79">Russell, 1949<I>b</I></A>). A similar clumping of granules gives the "dilute" effect to hairs of 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856004" target="_blank"><I>d</I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856004" target="_blank"><I>d</I></A> 
mice because of decreased light absorption although pigment volume is little affected.

<P>Though the variable attributes of pigment granules in the hair are in many ways interdependent, four key pigmentation characteristics appear to be relatively independent of each other. 
These are (1) granule color, (2) granule size, (3) degree of pigmentation, and (4) granule clumping (
<A HREF="#ref21-78">Russell, 1949<I>a</I></A>).

<P>It has become evident from electron microscope studies of melanocytes of the retinal pigment epithelium of the mouse that one may investigate not only the ontogeny and 
migratory behavior of the melanoblast, but also the ontogeny of pigment granules within the melanocyte (Moyer, 
<A HREF="#ref21-58">1961</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref21-59">1963</A>). The fine structure of melanosomes in neural crest-derived melanocytes of the choroid, hair follicles, and iris in the mouse are identical except for 
size and uniformity to those of the retinal pigment epithelium (
<A HREF="#ref21-59">Moyer, 1963</A>). Those of the retina are irregular in size and shape and are generally much larger (
<A HREF="#ref21-51">Markert and Silvers, 1956</A>; 
<A HREF="#ref21-59">Moyer, 1963</A>). The morphogenesis and fine structure of pigment granules is discussed later in this chapter.

<P><B>TRANSPLANTATION AND RELATED EXPERIMENTS</B>

<P>Autonomy of the pigment cell is inferred from the discrete nature of patches of mutated somatic cells having different hair color persisting through successive hair molts. 
Experimentally this is demonstrated when the integrity of skin of mice of one color genotype is maintained following transplantation to a histocompatible host of another color 
genotype, and again when pigment develops from presumptive neural crest that is transplanted to the anterior chamber of the mouse eye, to mouse spleen, or to any suitable 
environment in another host species, <I>e.g.</I>, chick coelom. Again, autonomy is demonstrated <I>in vitro</I> when melanocytes in the skin of young mice continue to produce 
melanin after explantation to a suitable culture medium.

<P>In transplants of skin between fetal and newborn mice differing in color genotype the graft develops pigmentation like that of the donor except at the periphery of the graft (
<A HREF="#ref21-74">Reed and Sanders, 1937</A>; 
<A HREF="#ref21-73">Reed, 1938</A>). Here the hairs develop a color characteristic of homologous regions of the host except in the case of the agouti locus (to be discussed later). Reed (
<A HREF="#ref21-73">1938</A>), Reed and Henderson (
<A HREF="#ref21-73b">1940</A>), and Silvers and Russell (
<A HREF="#ref21-99">1955</A>) have shown conclusively that melanoblast migration into alien hair follicles accounts for the "pigment spread." The migration involves hair pigment rather 
than skin pigment and does not occur after follicle differentiation (
<A HREF="#ref21-73b">Reed and Henderson, 1940</A>; 
<A HREF="#ref21-7">Chase, 1949</A>). Pigment spread is not observed when transplants of general trunk-skin epidermis are made between adult mice (
<A HREF="#ref21-1">Billingham and Medawar, 1948</A>). The slight pigment spread that is observed when pigmented ear or tail skin is transplanted to white spotted or albino trunk 
areas or when nonpigmented ear skin is transplanted to a pigmented trunk area followed by treatment with a skin irritant known to stimulate melanogenesis is attributed to 
the passive transfer of pigment cells as a consequence of cell movements during wound healing (Silvers, 
<A HREF="#ref21-91">1956<I>b</I></A>, 
<A HREF="#ref21-96">1958<I>d</I></A>).

<P>By transplanting fetal or neonatal skin to a neonatal host, it is possible by virtue of the migratory ability of melanoblasts to produce the effect of having melanocytes 
of a given color genotype function in the hair follicle of another color genotype. This method has been of great value in the study of gene action at the level of the melanocyte 
and hair follicle, but these studies have been possible only through the existence of the requisite inbred mouse strains, their F<SUB>1</SUB> hybrids, and by appropriate gene 
substitutions in congenic color stocks of mice of the type developed by E.S. Russell.

<P><B>Agouti locus</B>

<P>The agouti alleles determine phaeomelanin (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856798" target="_blank"><I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I></A>, 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855930" target="_blank"><I>A<SUP>vy</SUP></I></A>) or eumelanin (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855937" target="_blank"><I>a</I></A>, 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855939" target="_blank"><I>a<SUP>e</SUP></I></A>), 
both phaeomelanin and eumelanin in the same hair at different levels (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855936" target="_blank"><I>A<SUP>w</SUP></I></A>, +), 
or a dorsal pigmentation different from ventral pigmentation (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855936" target="_blank"><I>A<SUP>w</SUP></I></A>,

There is much overlapping between members of the series, especially as new mutant genes are discovered so that it is difficult to place them in 
discrete classes. Mice of genotype

for example, have some yellow hairs in the region of the mammae, ears, and perineum, whereas mice of phenotype 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855930" target="_blank"><I>A<SUP>vy</SUP></I></A>/- and

<P>Phaeomelanin is found only in hair and melanocytes of the hair bulb. Other pigment in yellow-haired phenotypes, for example, that of the eyes, tail, feet, and ear skin, 
is eumelanin. Vibrissae and monotrichs of agouti mice are no banded. The two kinds of pigment and pattern differences specified by alleles at the agouti locus make it 
particularly suitable experimental material for the type of study to be determined.

<A HREF="#ref21-93">1958<I>a</I></A>, 
<A HREF="#ref21-94">1958<I>b</I></A>).

<P>Results of transplantation experiments at the agouti locus are best summarized by a quotation from Silvers (
<A HREF="#ref21-94">1958<I>b</I></A>): "... the agouti locus genotype of the receiving hair follicle determines whether a melanocyte will produce eumelanin or phaeomelanin. The receiving 
hair follicle also determines the pattern of pigmentation. ... ventrality and dorsality are not important <I>per se</I>, but together with their genetic constitution present 
different follicular environments which affect the expression of melanocytes."

<P>The next logical question in the retrograde analysis of gene action at the agouti locus would be: In what way is the cellular environment of the follicle 
altered to produce a change in the response of the melanocyte? A study of the action of the various agouti alleles in tissue culture by Cleffmann (
<A HREF="#ref21-13">1963</A>) has furnished some important clues as to how this may be done (discussed later in this chapter).

<P>The compound nature of the agouti locus, suspected by Wallace (
<A HREF="#ref21-104">1954</A>) has been proved by observing crossing over within the locus (
<A HREF="#ref21-80">Russell <I>et al.</I>, 1963</A>). The mutation

with or without genetic markers on either side, six (out of 2,247) exceptional agouti 
offspring presumed to be recombinants were recovered. Another pseudoallele (?), agouti suppressor (<I>As</I>), 
which causes a darkening of the middorsum has been reported (Phillips, 
<A HREF="#ref21-62">1961</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref21-63">1963</A>). The existence of dual genetic determiners for dorsal and ventral pigmentation is at once implied but in the absence of additional data it must remain 
a possibility only. Regional differences in pigmentation can be plausibly explained in terms of physiologically different cell environments (see comments of 
<A HREF="#ref21-47">Loosli, 1963</A>).

<P><B>Brown, albino, dilute, leaden, and pink-eyed dilution loci</B>

<P>Transplantation experiments, of the type described for the agouti locus or as an adjunct to experiments at the agouti locus, have shown that gene action of each of the brown (

melanocytes have fewer and finer dendritic processes, and pigment granules are clumped around the nucleus (
<A HREF="#ref21-50">Markert and Silvers, 1956</A>). This type of pigment cell has been called nucleopetal as opposed to the normal type of pigment cell called nucleofugal (
<A HREF="#ref21-50">Markert and Silvers, 1956</A>). Because of the clumped nature of granules in the hair and the decrease in light absorption, the coat of such mice 
appears "dilute" or "leaden." Another mutant, "slate" (a remutation of beige, 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855968" target="_blank"><I>bg</I></A>),

to the anterior chamber of the eye of albino or pink-eyed dilution hosts (
<A HREF="#ref21-51">Markert and Silvers, 1959</A>). Each of these environments supports melanoblast differentiation and function. Melanoblasts having a nucleofugal genetic potential 
differentiate into nucleofugal melanocytes only, whereas melanoblasts having nucleopetal genetic potential differentiate into nucleopetal, nucleofugal, and intermediate forms. 
The results were interpreted to mean that host environment greatly influences number and size of dendritic extensions of melanocytes within limits established by the genotype. 
Those melanoblasts differentiating in the spleen had fewer and finer dendrites than did those in the less restrictive environment of the eye. Some

<P><B>White spotting vs. albinism</B>

<P>White spotting must be considered etiologically distinct from albinism. Whereas amelanotic melanocytes (clear cells) are present in albino hair follicles of mice (
<a href="javascript:windowf2104 = window.open('../figures/figure21-4.shtml', 'windowf2104', 'width=900,height=750,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf2104.focus()">Figure 21-4</A>), 
hereditary white spotting is characterized by the absence of these and other pigment cells from the hair follicle (
<A HREF="#ref21-12">Chase <I>et al.</I>, 1951</A>; Silvers, 
<A HREF="#ref21-89">1953</A>,

<A HREF="#ref21-95">1958<I>c</I></A>; 
<A HREF="#ref21-54">Mayer and Maltby, 1964</A>). That the large hyalinated cells found in hair bulbs of albino mice are amelanotic melanocytes is 
supported by different kinds of experimental evidence. Silvers (
<A HREF="#ref21-89">1953</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref21-90">1956<I>a</I></A>) observed in histological sections that clear cells occupied locations comparable to those of melanocytes of 
lightly pigmented types such as

genotype. Melanocytes of black and yellow mice 
that are depigmented by biotin deficiency or by X-irradiation are similar in morphology to the follicular clear cells of albino (
<A HREF="#ref21-11">Chase and Rauch, 1950</A>; Quevedo, 
<A HREF="#ref21-66">1956</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref21-67">1957</A>). Further, clear cells of albino hair follicles and melanocytes of pigmented types have comparable sensitivity to radiation; 
both are readily destroyed by X-irradiation of the resting hair follicles.

(dilute brown) donors. Grafts developing from tissues having no neural crest cells, whether from 
albino or pigmented donors, lacked clear cells and were characterized by hair matrices of regularly arranged cells of equal size; those containing 
neural crest cells from albino donors produced hair bulbs with clear cells, while those from potentially pigmented donors produced melanocytes.

<P>Theoretically a mutant gene causing restriction of pigment on the integument (white spotting) may act at any stage from differentiation of the melanoblast 
from the neural crest to the time of final differentiation of melanoblast to melanocyte within the hair follicle or in the skin. It is generally agreed that 
melanocytes in white spotted areas are either absent, undifferentiated, or abnormally differentiated. Possible reasons for the absence of melanoblasts from 
a white spot are enumerated by Billingham and Silvers (
<A HREF="#ref21-2">1960</A>) and Silvers (
<A HREF="#ref21-97">1961</A>). These are (1) a neural crest defect, <I>e.g.</I>, as might result from a disturbance of the region of the developing embryo which 
includes the neural crest and which therefore interferes with the differentiation of its cells, (2) a migratory defect which results in the melanoblast 
not reaching all or some areas of the embryo, or (3) a failure of potentially pigmented cells to survive in the "spotted environment."

<P>Important alternative to distinguish, which may not be mutually exclusive, are whether gene action is mediated via the cellular environment or resides 
within the melanoblast. Markert and Silvers (
<A HREF="#ref21-50">1956</A>) believed, though did not establish, that cellular environment is responsible for failure of melanoblast differentiation at some early 
stage in development for mutant spotting genes steel (

<A HREF="#ref21-50">Markert and Silvers, 1956</A>). This was mostly inferred from the nonrandom distribution of melanocytes among different tissues (retina, choroid, 
hair follicle, ear skin, harderian gland, nictitans) which emphasized the importance of given tissue in supporting melanoblast differentiation. Evidence 
presented later in this chapter shows that 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856392" target="_blank"><I>ls</I></A> (and therefore probably 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856148" target="_blank"><I>s</I></A>,

<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856173" target="_blank"><I>Sp</I></A>) and silver (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:98301" target="_blank"><I>si</I></A>) 
are believed to act within the melanoblast at an early stage of melanoblast differentiation.

<P>All-white mice of genotype

have frequently been referred to as having "one large spot" because of the 
demonstrable absence of melanocytes in skin and hair follicles (Silvers 
<A HREF="#ref21-89">1953</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref21-90">1956</A>). Working with alleles at this locus, Markert and Silvers explanted

embryonic tissue containing neural crest into the anterior chamber of the eye of albino hosts. No pigment cells were ever obtained from these grafts, 
indicating failure of neural crest differentiation (
<A HREF="#ref21-49">Markert, 1960</A>). Since control grafts from potentially pigmented neural crest frequently did not produce pigment, results must be interpreted 
with caution. Any effect of a "spotted environment" would have to be transitory or involve a certain critical period since white spotted areas do not 
inhibit melanogenesis. This has been shown by transplants of neural crest cells from potentially pigmented donors (
<A HREF="#ref21-99">Silvers and Russell, 1955</A>) and by pigment spread to white spotted regions (
<A HREF="#ref21-91">Silvers, 1956<I>b</I></A>).

<P>Mayer and Maltby (
<A HREF="#ref21-54">1964</A>) reexamined the problem of melanoblast differentiation in white spotted mice having the mutant genes belted (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856473" target="_blank"><I>bt</I></A>) and lethal spotting (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856392" target="_blank"><I>ls</I></A>). 
They demonstrated, by a series of grafts from different regions of fetal mice to chick coelom, that melanoblasts <I>were present</I> in prospective 
white spotted areas in the vicinity of hair follicles of 12&#189;-day fetuses in 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856473" target="_blank"><I>bt</I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856473" target="_blank"><I>bt</I></A> 
mice. However, no melanoblasts were demonstrated in prospective white spotted areas of presumed

<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856392" target="_blank"><I>ls</I></A> 
mice of equivalent age or older. Thus white spotting in 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856473" target="_blank"><I>bt</I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856473" target="_blank"><I>bt</I></A> 
mice is due either to a failure of melanoblasts to gain entrance into the developing hair follicles or to a failure to differentiate, whereas white spotting in 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856392" target="_blank"><I>ls</I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856392" target="_blank"><I>ls</I></A> 
mice represents either a failure to migrate into the dermis of the white areas or failure to differentiate in this region even when 
transplanted to the suitable environment of the chick coelom. Neural crest disturbance is suspected in lethal spotting (from occurrence of megacolon) and in 
splotch (from occurrence of cranial and caudal rachischisis).

<P>The presence of amelanotic melanocytes in a "white spot" is suggested in a study by Takeuchi (
<A HREF="#ref21-103">1964</A>) who observed transfilter pigment spread between 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856088" target="_blank"><I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I></A>/

skin and melanoma in tissue culture similar to, but less than, that observed between albino and melanoma 
under the same conditions. If amelanotic melanocytes are present in skin from mice of genotype

they exhibit little if any tyrosinase activity. Tyrosine-2-C<SUP>14</SUP> incorporated <I>in vitro</I> 
into skin of 5-day-old mice was greatly reduced in all-white 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856088" target="_blank"><I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856088" target="_blank"><I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I></A> or white spotted regions of

<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856088" target="_blank"><I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I></A> genotypes (
<A HREF="#ref21-107">Wolfe and Coleman, 1964</A>).

<P>The degree of spotting is modified greatly by other genes. Some, such as those affecting 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856148" target="_blank"><I>s</I></A> and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856232" target="_blank"><I>W</I></A>, 
are discussed later in this chapter. Other pigment genes frequently interact in a synergistic manner, as for example patch (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:97571" target="_blank"><I>Ph</I></A>) and viable dominant spotting (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856266" target="_blank"><I>W<SUP>v</SUP></I></A>). The double heterozygote 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:97571" target="_blank"><I>Ph</I></A>/+ 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856266" target="_blank"><I>W<SUP>v</SUP></I></A>/+ (

usually has pigment restricted to the head (
<A HREF="#ref21-37">Gr&#252;neberg and Truslove, 1960</A>). A similar restriction of pigment is found in double heterozygotes of 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:97571" target="_blank"><I>Ph</I></A> with 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856232" target="_blank"><I>W</I></A>, 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856161" target="_blank"><I>Sl</I></A>, or 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856164" target="_blank"><I>Sl<SUP>d</SUP></I></A> 
(Wolfe, unpublished data). This suggests a common cause for 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856232" target="_blank"><I>W</I></A>- and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:96974" target="_blank"><I>Sl</I></A>-series 
mutants, each of which exhibits a triad of effects, <I>i.e.</I>, varying degrees of macrocytic anemia, infertility, and reduced pigmentation (Chapters 
<A HREF="chapter17.shtml">17</A>, 
<A HREF="chapter29.shtml">29</A>). Yellow (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856798" target="_blank"><I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I></A>) 
generally causes reduction in size of white spots when in combination with spotting genes (
<A HREF="#ref21-28">Dunn <I>et al.</I>, 1937</A>).

<P>Different kinds of white spotting at different loci need not have a common etiology. About 27 mutant alleles at 13 loci exhibiting various degrees 
of white spotting and diverse pleiotropic effects have been described (see 
<a href="javascript:windowt2101 = window.open('../tables/table21-1.shtml', 'windowt2101', 'width=1000,height=1000,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt2101.focus()">Table 21-1</A>). 
Thus spotting genes probably act in varied ways and at different times.

<P><B>BIOSYNTHESIS OF MELANIN</B>

<P>Naturally occurring melanin is a polymer of indole-5,6-quinone which is copolymerized with protein to form melanin granules. The indole-5,6-quinone 
arises from the multistep oxidation of tyrosine by the enzyme tyrosinase (
<A HREF="#ref21-44">Lerner and Fitzpatrick, 1960</A>; Mason, 
<A HREF="#ref21-52">1955</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref21-53">1959</A>; 
<A HREF="#ref21-102">Swan, 1963</A>). Whether this enzyme is required in all steps of this reaction is not known. The best evidence suggests that tyrosinase 
must be involved in the initial conversion of tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and probably in the conversion of DOPA to dopaquinone, 
although this reaction and all subsequent reactions in the series can proceed spontaneously but at a slower rate in the absence of tyrosinase. 
Although tyrosine is generally accepted to be a precursor of eumelanin (black or brown), tryptophan has been suggested as the natural precursor of 
phaeomelanin (yellow) and considerable effort has been made to demonstrate that neither tyrosine or tyrosinase are directly 
involved in the production of this pigment (
<A HREF="#ref21-30">Foster, 1951</A>; 
<A HREF="#ref21-60">Nachmias, 1959</A>).

<P><B>Methods of enzymatic assay</B>

<P>Assays for tyrosinase activity are complicated both because of the insolubility of the enzyme as it occurs in mouse skin and because of the variety 
of products which are produced by the enzyme before any true pigment (melanin) is formed. Since the conversion of tyrosine to DOPA is extremely slow, 
involving a long lag period even in the presence of large amounts of enzyme, many investigators have used DOPA as the preferred substrate in enzyme assays. 
This reaction proceeds rapidly and the rate can be conveniently assayed manometrically by measuring oxygen uptake or colorimetrically by measuring the 
formation of dopaquinone, a colored precursor of melanin. These methods have serious limitations (
<A HREF="#ref21-29">Fitzpatrick and Kukita, 1959</A>) as DOPA is not the natural substrate (
<A HREF="#ref21-41">Kim and Tchen, 1962</A>) and it is capable of being oxidized by a variety of nonspecific oxidases. Thus, unless pure solutions of tyrosinase 
are being studied it is difficult to assess how much oxygen is being consumed by spontaneous oxidation of DOPA or by nonspecific oxidases present in 
the crude tissues. If a colorimetric assay is used instead, the variety of colored products (all absorbing at different wavelengths), formed from DOPA 
spontaneously and enzymatically, make an assay based on color development alone quite difficult. Some of the same difficulties are involved using 
tyrosine as substrate, and it seems that in most experiments involving skin slices or tissues from mice a variety of methods using both substrates should be employed.

<P>Fitzpatrick and Kukita (
<A HREF="#ref21-29">1959</A>) developed a radioautographic assay system which provided a direct measurement of the amount of radioactive tyrosine 
incorporated into the newly synthesized melanin of melanocytes. Although this method was difficult to quantify, it was a considerable improvement 
over the previous histochemical technique using DOPA as substrate (
<A HREF="#ref21-3">Bloch, 1947</A>). This method was modified in subsequent investigations by Coleman (
<A HREF="#ref21-16">1962</A>) and Kim and Tchen (
<A HREF="#ref21-41">1962</A>). In both modifications, after incubation with radioactive tyrosine the tissue was dissolved or otherwise treated in order 
to plate it out on planchets for actual counting of the amount of radioisotope incorporated. These procedures were specific for rate of melanin 
formation from the natural substrate tyrosine and were extremely quantitative. It should be emphasized that such an assay system is not a direct 
measurement of the tyrosinase present in the tissue but only of that which is physiologically active under the assay conditions.

<P><B>Effect of genic substitution on tyrosinase activity</B>

<P>Tyrosinase activity and its relationship to the amount and types of melanin found in various coat color mutations in 
mice has been studied in great detail primarily by geneticists (
<A HREF="#ref21-84">Russell and Russell, 1948</A>; Foster, 
<A HREF="#ref21-30">1951</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref21-31">1959</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref21-32">1963</A>), although later the problem of gene action in pigment mutants has interested workers in other disciplines (
<A HREF="#ref21-29">Fitzpatrick and Kukita, 1959</A>; Coleman, 
<A HREF="#ref21-15">1960</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref21-16">1962</A>; Moyer 
<A HREF="#ref21-58">1961</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref21-59">1963</A>). In general, the results of all these investigations are in good agreement, but in some cases it is hard to make valid comparisons 
between the work of different investigators because of the varieties of mouse genotypes and the diverse assay systems employed.

<P>Tyrosinase activity in skin was found to vary with age of the mouse (
<A HREF="#ref21-30">Foster, 1951</A>; 
<A HREF="#ref21-16">Coleman, 1962</A>), more specifically with the stage of the hair cycle (
<A HREF="#ref21-29">Fitzpatrick and Kukita, 1959</A>). The latter authors using the radioautographic method and studying the changes in tyrosinase activity during 
the hair cycle found no detectable tyrosine incorporation until the appearance of pigmented melanocytes in the hair bulb. This occurred about 4 days after 
the hair was plucked. Tyrosinase activity increased to a maximum between the sixth and 14th days and by the 24th day no activity could be demonstrated. Foster (
<A HREF="#ref21-30">1951</A>) found that skins of baby mice between the ages of 4 and 9 days had the highest tyrosinase activity. Also skins from mice of this age are 
particularly amenable for study since they can be pulverized easily in a mortar and pestle after freezing with dry ice. Coleman (
<A HREF="#ref21-16">1962</A>) established that in mice of at least two strains (C57BL/6J and C57BR/cdJ) the maximum tyrosinase activity (without resorting to plucking) 
occurred at 5 +/- 0.5 days.

<P><B><I>Albino locus.</I></B> The alleles at the albino (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:98880" target="_blank"><I>c</I></A>) 
locus have been studied extensively by the histochemical DOPA oxidase technique (
<A HREF="#ref21-84">Russell and Russell, 1948</A>). This method demonstrated that the DOPA oxidase activity corresponded in the series of alleles at this locus 
to what would be expected from visual examination of the genotypes, <I>i.e.</I>, +/+ >

<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855976" target="_blank"><I>c</I></A>. No activity was detected in the albino (
<a href="javascript:windowf2102a = window.open('../figures/figure21-2A.shtml', 'windowf2102a', 'width=500,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf2102a.focus()">Figure 21-2<I>A</I></A>). 
Similar results were obtained by Coleman (
<A HREF="#ref21-16">1962</A>) using the radioactive assay for tyrosinase. It was of interest that the genotype \
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855976" target="_blank"><I>c</I></A>/+ was distinguishable from +/+ biochemically, 
whereas no visual differences can be observed. In every case, mice heterozygous for the alleles at this locus had intermediate and predictable activities 
when compared with the homozygous genotypes.

<P>The allele himalayan (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855979" target="_blank"><I>c<SUP>h</SUP></I></A>) 
was of particular interest in these studies since the tyrosinase in the skins from mice homozygous for this allele (
<a href="javascript:windowf2102g = window.open('../figures/figure21-2G.shtml', 'windowf2102g', 'width=500,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf2102g.focus()">Figure 21-1<I>G</I></A>) 
was heat labile. This thermolability of the tyrosinase suggests that this allele and thus, by inference, all alleles at the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:98880" target="_blank"><I>c</I></A> 
locus control the structure and not the quantity of the enzyme produced. Further evidence (Coleman, unpublished data) comes from an electrophoretic study of 
tyrosinases isolated from the skins of mice carrying various alleles at the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:98880" target="_blank"><I>c</I></A> locus. 
Whereas the tyrosinase from wild-type mice (+/+) produced two distinct tyrosinase bands on electrophoresis, similar preparations from chinchilla mice (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855977" target="_blank"><I>c<SUP>ch</SUP></I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855977" target="_blank"><I>c<SUP>ch</SUP></I></A>) (
<a href="javascript:windowf2101c = window.open('../figures/figure21-1C.shtml', 'windowf2101c', 'width=500,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf2101c.focus()">Figure 21-1<I>C</I></A>) 
produced only one band, which was faster moving than either of the two wild-type tyrosinases. Again when enzyme from himalayan 
mice was similarly studied, two tyrosinases were produced, the fastest-moving of which corresponded to the fastest-moving wild-type component. The slower-moving 
component from the himalayan mice was however much slower moving than its counterpart from wild-type mice.

<P><B><I>Brown locus.</I></B>

<P>The action of genic substitution at the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855960" target="_blank"><I>b</I></A> 
locus on tyrosinase activity in mice has been studied by several investigators (
<A HREF="#ref21-84">Russell and Russell, 1948</A>; Foster, 
<A HREF="#ref21-30">1951</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref21-31">1959</A>; 
<A HREF="#ref21-29">Fitzpatrick and Kukita, 1959</A>; 
<A HREF="#ref21-16">Coleman, 1962</A>). All these investigations established that the brown mice (
<a href="javascript:windowf2101f = window.open('../figures/figure21-1F.shtml', 'windowf2101f', 'width=500,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf2101f.focus()">Figure 21-1F</A>) 
surprisingly had equally as much tyrosinase as black mice (
<a href="javascript:windowf2101d = window.open('../figures/figure21-1D.shtml', 'windowf2101d', 'width=500,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf2101d.focus()">Figure 21-1D</A>). 
In fact in most studies it appeared the brown mice actually had twice the amount of tyrosinase. Numerous explanations have been 
advanced to explain this apparently anomalous result. Foster (
<A HREF="#ref21-31">1959</A>) suggested that under conditions <I>in vivo</I> the substrate, tyrosine, is limiting, a situation which is not 
the case <I>in vitro</I>. Fitzpatrick and Kukita (
<A HREF="#ref21-29">1959</A>) thought that the brown granules developed more slowly and at the time of assay, being not so fully developed, 
retained more active tyrosinase sites on their surface. Coleman (
<A HREF="#ref21-16">1962</A>) showed that limitation of substrate <I>in vivo</I> is not involved, since injecting trace amounts of 
tyrosine-C<SUP>14</SUP> into baby mice and letting the incubation run <I>in vivo</I> gave identical results to those seen <I>in vitro</I>. 
Also the time course of development of black and brown granules appeared to be the same (see earlier section) in both genotypes of mice. The wild-type allele 
in these studies was seen to be dominant and no heterozygous effect could be noticed in these enzyme assays. The gene appears to have a marked effect on the 
size and shape of the pigment granules as well as influencing tyrosinase activity. This suggests that the primary function of this gene is the production of 
the basic matrix of the granule which provides binding sites for structural tyrosinase as controlled by the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:98880" target="_blank"><I>c</I></A> locus.

<P><B><I>Agouti locus.</I></B>

<P>The series of alleles at the agouti locus is responsible for the presence or absence of yellow banding in hair (see 
<a href="javascript:windowf2101b = window.open('../figures/figure21-1B.shtml', 'windowf2101b', 'width=500,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf2101b.focus()">Figure 21-1<I>B</I></A> 
for typical agouti pattern). The control exerted by this locus is sensitive enough to change the type of pigment from 
eumelanin to phaeomelanin within the space of one or two medullary cells. Much confusion has developed concerning the mode of action of this locus on pigmentation. Foster (
<A HREF="#ref21-30">1951</A>) found that oxygen uptake in pulverized yellow (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856798" target="_blank"><I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855937" target="_blank"><I>a</I></A>) 
skin was greatly stimulated when tryptophan was substituted for tyrosine as substrate. Concurrent with this was a production 
of a yellow pigment rather than the abnormal black pigment formed by these genetically yellow skins from tyrosine. Little tyrosinase activity was seen in these preparations, and when nonagouti (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855937" target="_blank"><I>a</I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855937" target="_blank"><I>a</I></A>) skin was mixed with yellow (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856798" target="_blank"><I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855937" target="_blank"><I>a</I></A>) 
skin an actual inhibition of the tyrosinase activity normally present in the

<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855937" target="_blank"><I>a</I></A> 
skin was seen. These data suggested that tryptophan was the precursor of yellow pigment and that the yellow pigment was produced 
in spite of the residual tyrosinase activity present because of the tyrosinase inhibitor found in yellow skin (see also 
<A HREF="#ref21-60">Nachmias 1959</A>). Similarly Fitzpatrick and Kukita (
<A HREF="#ref21-29">1959</A>), although demonstrating the incorporation of tyrosine-C<SUP>14</SUP> <I>in vitro</I> into pigment, suggested that tyrosine was 
not really the natural precursor because this pigment formed <I>in vitro</I> from tyrosine was black rather than the expected yellow. Coleman (
<A HREF="#ref21-16">1962</A>) showed that tryptophan injected into baby mice was not incorporated into yellow, black, or brown pigment <I>in vivo</I>, 
whereas tyrosine-C<SUP>14</SUP> was incorporated into all types of pigment, although at a somewhat reduced rate in yellow mice when compared with their nonagouti (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855937" target="_blank"><I>a</I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855937" target="_blank"><I>a</I></A>) 
black or brown counterparts. Skin slices also failed to incorporate tyrosine-C<SUP>14</SUP> at abut one-third the normal rate 
seen for nonagouti mice. These observations strongly suggest that tyrosine, not tryptophan, is the natural precursor to both eumelanin and phaeomelanin. 
The reduced rate at which tyrosine was incorporated into phaeomelanin suggests that the normal sequence of events leading to eumelanin formation is 
interrupted or diverted by the presence of the yellow allele, possibly resulting in a smaller polymer with the changed physical properties.

<P>An inhibitor, as observed by Foster (
<A HREF="#ref21-30">1951</A>), is implicated in this interruption of melanogenesis. Tissue culture studies have demonstrated that all hair melanocytes in skin explants 
from mice homozygous for the + allele at the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:98881" target="_blank"><I>b</I></A> 
locus when grown <I>in vitro</I> produce black pigment regardless of whether the skin came from nonagouti (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855937" target="_blank"><I>a</I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855937" target="_blank"><I>a</I></A>), yellow (

<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855937" target="_blank"><I>a</I></A>), 
or agouti (+/+) mice (
<A HREF="#ref21-13">Cleffman, 1963</A>). On addition of sulfhydryl (SH) compounds such as reduced glutathione to the medium, all skin explants could be made to produce 
yellow pigment which was indistinguishable from naturally occurring yellow pigment. Although all genotypes could be made to produce yellow pigment <I>in vitro</I>, 
the maximum concentration of SH required to change the developing pigment from black to yellow varied from genotype to genotype. Thus 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856798" target="_blank"><I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855937" target="_blank"><I>a</I></A> melanocytes required less SH to produce yellow pigment than did

<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855937" target="_blank"><I>a</I></A> 
melanocytes. The amount required to produce 
this change, once established, remained constant throughout the growth period <I>in vitro</I>. In contrast skins from mice homozygous for the agouti alleles (+/+,

<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855941" target="_blank"><I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I></A>) 
exhibited a rhythmic cyclic requirement in the amount of SH required to keep the pigment yellow. Thus during the first 
days of growth <I>in vitro</I> (period when black tips of hair are being made) a high level of SH was required equal to that seen in 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855937" target="_blank"><I>a</I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855937" target="_blank"><I>a</I></A> 
mice. During the period when yellow pigment would be produced less SH was required and after this the requirement 
increased again as the cells attempted to synthesize black pigment.

<P><B><I>Pink-eyed dilution locus.</I></B>

<P>Mice homozygous for pink-eyed dilution (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:97454" target="_blank"><I>p</I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:97454" target="_blank"><I>p</I></A>), 
have markedly reduced pigmentation in the hair and eyes (
<a href="javascript:windowf2101h = window.open('../figures/figure21-1H.shtml', 'windowf2101h', 'width=500,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf2101h.focus()">Figure 21-1<I>H</I></A>). 
This gene reduces the activity of tyrosinase as measured by incorporation studies (
<A HREF="#ref21-29">Fitzpatrick and Kukita, 1959</A>; 
<A HREF="#ref21-16">Coleman, 1962</A>) and histochemical studies (
<A HREF="#ref21-84">Russell and Russell, 1948</A>). In contrast Foster (
<A HREF="#ref21-31">1959</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref21-32">1963</A>), using the manometric method with both tyrosine and DOPA as substrates, found that this allele greatly enhanced the enzyme activity over 
that seen in wild-type (+/+) mice. This increased oxygen uptake does not measure the amount of pigment formed as do the other methods and may represent nonspecific 
tyrosine or DOPA oxidases which are not involved in pigment formation per se but which in fact compete for substrates and thus prevent normal pigment synthesis. 
Studies on the fine structure (see later section) suggest that pink-eye prevents the normal cross-linking seen between parallel fibers within pigment granules. 
Just how this will correlate with the biochemical action is at present unknown.

<P><B><I>Other loci.</I></B>

<P>Other genes affecting pigmentation, such as ruby-eye (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:2181763" target="_blank"><I>ru</I></A>), leaden (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856674" target="_blank"><I>ln</I></A>) and dilute (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856004" target="_blank"><I>d</I></A>), 
have also been studied with respect to tyrosinase activity. Briefly, mice homozygous for ruby-eye (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:2181763" target="_blank"><I>ru</I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:2181763" target="_blank"><I>ru</I></A>) 
have slightly decreased tyrosinase activity. This may be related to the delay in development of the granule as seen morphologically. Leaden mice (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856674" target="_blank"><I>ln</I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856674" target="_blank"><I>ln</I></A>) 
have normal tyrosinase activities as do dilute mice (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856004" target="_blank"><I>d</I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856004" target="_blank"><I>d</I></A>). 
Both these genes have the effect of diluting visible pigmentation by causing an abnormal clumping of a normal number of granules.

<P><B>Effect of pigment genes on other enzymes</B>

<P>Although the dilute locus has no direct effect on tyrosinase it has been shown to reduce the activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase, which converts phenylalanine to tyrosine (
<A HREF="#ref21-16">Coleman, 1960</A>). In mice homozygous for the dilute allele (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856004" target="_blank"><I>d</I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856004" target="_blank"><I>d</I></A>) 
the phenylalanine hydroxylase activity is reduced 30 to 50 per cent when compared with congenic nondilute (+/+) mice. The activity of this 
enzyme is reduced still further (85 per cent) in mice homozygous for the dilute lethal allele (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856005" target="_blank"><I>d<SUP>l</SUP></I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856005" target="_blank"><I>d<SUP>l</SUP></I></A>). This decrease is not caused by an enzyme deficiency but instead by abnormal production of an inhibitor of phenylalanine 
hydroxylase associated with the microsomal fraction of liver homogenates. Neither the inhibitor nor the enzyme is present in newborn mice (
<A HREF="#ref21-68">Rauch and Yost, 1963</A>) but both develop in the first 3 weeks of postnatal life in both dilute and nondilute genotypes. However, in normal 
mice (+/+) the production of the inhibitor stops between the second and third week and the amount of inhibitor decreases to adult levels. This disappearance in 
inhibitor permits an increase in the effective concentration <I>in vivo</I> of phenylalanine hydroxylase. In dilute mice (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856004" target="_blank"><I>d</I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856004" target="_blank"><I>d</I></A>) or dilute lethal mice (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856005" target="_blank"><I>d<SUP>l</SUP></I></A>) 
the inhibitor concentrations remain high, preventing normal phenylalanine hydroxylase activity <I>in vivo</I> in these dilute genotypes.

<P>This inhibition of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity would be expected to decrease tyrosine levels in adult mice, and thus lack of 
substrate for the tyrosinase reaction could cause the diluted pigmentation. However, this is not the case, since Russell (
<A HREF="#ref21-77">1948</A>) established that dilute hairs contain as many pigment granules as do nondilute. Instead the dilution in pigment is related to the clumping 
of the individual granules. These clumps originate in the follicular melanocytes which are morphologically abnormal in that they lack dendritic processes. 
The transplantation experiments of Markert and Silvers (
<A HREF="#ref21-50">1956</A>) indicate that melanocytic differentiation in dilute genotypes begins as early as the ninth day of gestation, prior to the development 
of either phenylalanine hydroxylase or the inhibitor. This would not necessarily rule out an abnormal concentration of phenylalanine or of its metabolites 
at some critical period of development as the cause of this abnormal pigmentation. In fact, Wilde (
<A HREF="#ref21-105">1955</A>) has shown that phenylalanine plays an important role in the differentiation of neural crest derivatives including melanocytes.

<P>Dilute mice, although not actually lacking in phenylalanine hydroxylase, do exhibit some symptoms of the human condition phenylketonuria. Dilute (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856004" target="_blank"><I>d</I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856004" target="_blank"><I>d</I></A>) 
mice are subject to audiogenic seizures, whereas dilute lethal mice (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856005" target="_blank"><I>d<SUP>l</SUP></I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856005" target="_blank"><I>d<SUP>l</SUP></I></A>) 
have spontaneous convulsive seizures. Both dilute genotypes produce and excrete abnormal amounts of 
phenylketones and phenylacetic acid which could be toxic to the central nervous system. Kelton and Rauch (
<A HREF="#ref21-40">1962</A>) have demonstrated myelin degeneration in dilute lethal mice, a condition often seen in human phenylketonurics. Thus we see striking 
phenotypical similarities between human phenylketonuria and dilution in mice even though the genetic defect is quite different.

<P><B>ULTRASTRUCTURE OF PIGMENT GRANULES</B>

<P>The fine structure of the developing pigment granule in the mouse eye has been studied extensively by Moyer (
<A HREF="#ref21-56">1959</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref21-57">1960</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref21-58">1961</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref21-59">1963</A>). Electron microscopy has revealed that melanogenesis progresses in a definite sequence which can be interrupted or mediated by the action of genes (
<A HREF="#ref21-88">Seiji <I>et al.</I>, 1963</A>; Moyer, 
<A HREF="#ref21-58">1961</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref21-59">1963</A>). The same general pattern of development of the melanosome was observed for all genotypes studied. In the earliest stage (stage 1), 
thin unit fibers aggregate to form compound fibers within a membranous boundary. The shape of the melanosome develops as these fibers cross-link and 
become oriented parallel to each other (stage 2). When this orientation is complete, melanin is deposited on this matrix at definite sites along these fibers 
(stage 3). As this deposition continues the details of the matrix are obscured by the electron-dense melanin (stage 4). This last stage represents the typical 
mature melanin granule as seen through the light microscope.

<P>Closer examination revealed that the compound fibers within the melanosome (stage 2) show a primary or first-order periodicity of approximately 65 to 85 &#197;. 
This measurement varies slightly with the genotype. As the melanin is deposited at discrete sites along these fibers, a second-order periodicity is conferred 
on the fiber which is controlled by the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:98881" target="_blank"><I>b</I></A> locus.

<P><B>Genetic variation in retinal melanosomes</B>

<P>Of the six genetic loci studied by Moyer, only the albino (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:98880" target="_blank"><I>c</I></A>), brown (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:98881" target="_blank"><I>b</I></A>), and pink-eyed dilution (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:97454" target="_blank"><I>p</I></A>) 
loci were found to affect 
the fine structure of the developing melanosome. The dilute (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856004" target="_blank"><I>d</I></A>) and leaden (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856674" target="_blank"><I>ln</I></A>) 
loci although not altering the fine structure or tyrosinase activity of the melanosome do affect the clumping of granules. Although these two 
genes closely mimic each other in most respects, no clumping of retinal melanosomes was observed in mice homozygous for 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856674" target="_blank"><I>ln</I></A> 
whereas clumping was seen for dilute (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856004" target="_blank"><I>d</I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856004" target="_blank"><I>d</I></A>) 
homozygotes. Similarly the dilute locus affects phenylalanine hydroxylase whereas leaden does not, suggesting that these two loci effect 
their action by different means. The gene ruby-eye (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:2181763" target="_blank"><I>ru</I></A>) 
was also without effect on the size, shape, or fine structure of the melanosome, but instead seemed to delay the onset of pigmentation.

<P>Mice homozygous for the recessive allele brown (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855960" target="_blank"><I>b</I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855960" target="_blank"><I>b</I></A>) 
when compared with the black (+/+) mice revealed differences in size, shape, and fine structure of the melanin granule. The melanin 
in mature brown granules as seen with the electron microscope was flocculent, coarsely granular, and often the underlying matrix could still be distinguished. 
In contrast, the melanin of black granules was finely granular and completely obscured the underlying matrix in mature granules. The shape of the brown 
granules usually was oval to spherical, whereas black granules varied from long rods to spheres but most were oval or rod-shaped. Brown granules were in 
general smaller but considerable variation was seen in these retinal preparations. In stage-3 granules, when melanin was just beginning to be deposited, 
second-order periodicity was observed which in black granules was in the order of 200 &#197; whereas in brown granules it was only 113 &#197;. The first-order 
periodicity seen in all granules remained unchanged. This second-order periodicity was interpreted to represent the active state of the enzyme tyrosinase. 
Thus the shorter distance between sites in brown granules would predict increased tyrosinase activity in brown tissues compared with those from black. 
This indeed is the case (see earlier section).

<P>The albino (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:98880" target="_blank"><I>c</I></A>) 
locus affects the amount of melanin within the granule as well as the size and shape of the granule. Biochemical evidence suggests 
that it controls the structure of the enzyme tyrosinase. In albino mice (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855976" target="_blank"><I>c</I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855976" target="_blank"><I>c</I></A>) 
the initial sequence of melanosome development is unaltered but no pigment is ever deposited on the thickened (stage-2) fibers, suggesting 
nonfunctional tyrosinase. Since there is no melanization of these fibers no second order periodicity was observed so no judgment could be made regarding 
whether the nonfunctional tyrosinase was present on these fibers. In mice homozygous for the alleles which do allow pigmentation (+/+, 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855977" target="_blank"><I>c<SUP>ch</SUP></I></A>/

<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855979" target="_blank"><I>c<SUP>h</SUP></I></A>) 
normal second-order periodicity was seen and its magnitude was related only to the allele present at the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:98881" target="_blank"><I>b</I></A> 
locus. In all cases the resulting mature granules were normal with respect to size and number. However, in mice homozygous for the allele extreme dilution (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855978" target="_blank"><I>c<SUP>e</SUP></I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855978" target="_blank"><I>c<SUP>e</SUP></I></A>) 
the granules were smaller in size and fewer in number.

<P>A study of melanosomes from pink-eyed dilution homozygotes (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:97454" target="_blank"><I>p</I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:97454" target="_blank"><I>p</I></A>) 
revealed that early in development the fibers of melanosomes do not become arranged in the orderly parallel fashion. Also much less cross-linking 
is seen. This leads to a mature granule smaller in size and extremely irregular in shape. Although the lack of orientation of the fiber matrix makes it difficult 
to assess the granularity of the melanin deposited, occasional melanosomes are found in which at least part of the matrix is fairly well oriented. A study of 
melanin in these areas shows that the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:97454" target="_blank"><I>p</I></A> 
locus does not affect the granularity of the melanin as determined by the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:98881" target="_blank"><I>b</I></A> 
locus nor is the second-order periodicity altered from what would be predicted.

<P><B>COLOR MOSAICISM</B>

<P>Aside from nongenetic changes in coat color, a coat having phenotypically distinct pigment areas or variegated (mottled) coat is indicative of 
(1) genetic change within a genome, (2) chimerism from polar body retention or fusion of zygotes, or (3) activity of a chromosome, part of a chromosome, or 
gene alternating with that of its homologue in given parts of the integument. The possible genetic causes of mosaicism in mice are reviewed by Gr&#252;neberg (
<A HREF="#ref21-35">1952</A>), and Russell (
<A HREF="#ref21-81">1964</A>), in mammals by Robinson (
<A HREF="#ref21-75">1957</A>), and in somatic cells of mammals by Klein (
<A HREF="#ref21-42">1963</A>). Color mosaics are theorized by Robinson (
<A HREF="#ref21-75">1957</A>) to be a result of (1) somatic gene mutation, (2) gross chromosome change, or (3) cellular dynamics. Gross chromosome 
changes include nondisjunction, deletion, inversion, duplication, and trisomy; cellular dynamics include somatic crossing over, somatic 
reduction, and redistribution of chromosomes. Mosaics may be somatic, somatic-gonadal, or gonadal type but are most often somatic. Robinson (
<A HREF="#ref21-75">1957</A>) could find 32 cases of color mosaic mice reported in the literature. Of these, 10 were known to involve the gonad.

<P>Wolfe (
<A HREF="#ref21-106">1963</A>) described an unusual type of mosaic mouse. An apparent allele of pink-eyed dilution spontaneously reverts with relatively high 
frequency (0.2 to 0.3 per cent in homozygotes) to wild type. Mosaic mice varied from those having a few dark hairs at only one place on the body to 
heavily mottled animals, the latter usually somatic-gonadal type. Eye color in mottled mice ranged from pink eye to full color, 
and often showed bilateral asymmetry. Russell and Major (
<A HREF="#ref21-82a">1956</A>) reported a similar type of mosaicism involving the mutant gene pearl (
<I>pe</I>), which is unstable on strain 101 background but stable on C3H background.

<P>Mice having wild-type patches of pigmented hairs are often observed in color mutants. Schaible and Gowen (
<A HREF="#ref21-86">1960</A>) for example reported an incidence of mosaics of 6 per cent for heterozygotes of white (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856088" target="_blank"><I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I></A>), 
10 per cent for heterozygotes of Ames dominant spotting (

<P>Color mosaicism has been induced by chemical mutagens (Strong,

from the cross C57BL x NB with 100 or 150 R. Controls consisted of irradiated fetuses of C57BL x C57BL matings, 
which were homozygous wild-type for the four color loci under study, and non-irradiated offspring of both types of mating. After correcting for mosaic animals 
observed in the three types of controls, the frequency of expression of recessive at one or another of the four coat color loci was calculated to be 10.1 per cent 
for the 100 R group (235 mice irradiated). Spots were randomly distributed and a single mutational event was postulated in each instance. None had mosaic eyes. 
The most conservative explanation is somatic mutation or deletion at the loci studied (
<A HREF="#ref21-82">Russell and Major, 1957</A>). The spotting observed in progeny of C57BL x NB matings differed from the small white spots which were always midventral 
and which were found only in irradiated fetuses of C57BL x C57BL matings. The significant increase in midventral spotting was interpreted to mean that irradiation 
killed some of the prospective pigment cells. Schaible (

ranging in age from &#189; to 11&#189; days in 1-day increments. There was a significant increase in number of mosaics in 2&#189;- and 10&#189;-day stages.

<P>One type of mosaicism can be explained on the basis of the X-chromosome inactivation hypothesis (
<A HREF="#ref21-48">Lyon, 1961</A>). According to this hypothesis only one X chromosome or part of the X chromosome (
<A HREF="#ref21-80">Russell, 1963</A>) is active in any one somatic cell. Inactivation is random, occurs early in embryonic development, and give rise to clones 
of cells in alternate states of genic activity. Thus females heterozygous for X chromosome-linked pigment genes (see 
<a href="javascript:windowf2102g = window.open('../figures/figure21-2G.shtml', 'windowf2102g', 'width=500,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf2102g.focus()">Figure 21-2<I>G</I></A>) 
or for pigment genes located in autosomal segments translocated to the X chromosome (see 
<a href="javascript:windowf2102h = window.open('../figures/figure21-2H.shtml', 'windowf2102h', 'width=500,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf2102h.focus()">Figure 21-2<I>H</I></A>) 
exhibit varied degrees of mosaicism. Eight different translocations to the X chromosome have been reported to date. 
Seven of these have been translocations of linkage group I and the other involves linkage group VIII (
<A HREF="#ref21-80">Russell, 1963</A>). Details concerning chromosome structure and behavior of X-chromosome inactivation mosaics can be found in Chapters 
<A HREF="chapter7.shtml">7</A> and 
<A HREF="chapter15.shtml">15</A>. The mechanism appears to be the same as that for sex-linked semidominant genes (usually lethal in the homozygote). 
In these, for example tortoise (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856101" target="_blank"><I>To</I></A>) (
<a href="javascript:windowf2102g = window.open('../figures/figure21-2G.shtml', 'windowf2102g', 'width=500,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf2102g.focus()">Figure 21-2<I>G</I></A>), 
the heterozygous female has alternate patches of black and yellow hairs (
<A HREF="#ref21-21">Dickie, 1954</A>), the particular color presumably depending on which X chromosome is active in a given part of the integument.

<P>A type of variegation that resembles the X-chromosome inactivation mosaic but which is not X-linked is varitint-waddler (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856230" target="_blank"><I>Va</I></A>,

has alternate areas of black, dilute (grey), and white (
<A HREF="#ref21-14">Cloudman and Bunker, 1945</A>). The cause of this mosaicism is not known.

<P><B>QUANTITATIVE INHERITANCE</B>

<P>In addition to named pigment genes there are many individually unidentified genes that modify or have slight effects on color or spotting. 
One has only to witness the expression of a given "spotting gene" on different inbred strain backgrounds to be convinced of this. The most 
thoroughly studied of the so-called modifying genes are the "<I>k</I> complex" and the "<I>m(W)</I> complex," affecting pattern and amount of white in piebald spotting (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856148" target="_blank"><I>s</I></A>) and dominant spotting (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856232" target="_blank"><I>W</I></A>) 
respectively, investigated extensively by L.C. Dunn and his associates (Dunn, 
<A HREF="#ref21-25">1937</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref21-26">1942</A>; 
<A HREF="#ref21-27">Dunn and Charles, 1937</A>; 
<A HREF="#ref21-28">Dunn <I>et al.</I>, 1937</A>; 
<A HREF="#ref21-6">Charles, 1938</A>). An excellent account of their work is given by Gr&#252;neberg (
<A HREF="#ref21-35">1952</A>). The modifying genes, some of which in the "k complex" are spotting genes in their own right, have small cumulative 
effects on amount of white and appear to exhibit a threshold effect. Divergent sublines obtained by selection and homozygous for 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1856148" target="_blank"><I>s</I></A> 
were nearly all-white but with black eyes or nearly full-colored at the other extreme.

<P>Essentially the same phenomenon has been observed during selection for increased amounts of white hair starting from a heterogeneous 
stock of nearly full-colored mice in experiments initiated in 1931 by Goodale, discontinued, then begun again by Kyle. Approximately two-thirds 
of the coat of mice of the selected population is white and some individuals reached the phenotypic limit of black-eyed white in 
the eighth generation of continued selection (
<A HREF="#ref21-43">Kyle and Goodale, 1963</A>).

<P>Though studies of genetic modifiers and of polygenic nature of small variations in coat color have added to our understanding of pigmentation, 
the great progress made in the genetics and physiology of mammalian pigmentation is directly attributable to the occurrence of different kinds of 
coat color mutations in mice and to their general availability in inbred strains. Thus gene action may be studied in a single 
cell type that is nearly autonomous. Also as Russell (
<A HREF="#ref21-76">1946</A>) pointed out the path between primary gene action and character must be relatively short in pigment formation.

<P><B>SUMMARY</B>

<P>Most of what is known of genetic and physiological control of pigmentation in mammals has come from studies of named pigment genes in the mouse. 
With a variety of techniques the biochemistry and morphogenesis of a single cell type, the pigment cell, and its unique product, melanin, have been studied.

<P>The source of all pigment in mice is a specialized pigment cell, the melanocyte. Two basic types of melanin are elaborated, eumelanin (black or brown) 
and phaeomelanin (yellow). Melanin forms as granules and remains within the melanocyte or is incorporated into developing hair cells. Melanocytes have two 
embryonic origins, the neural crest and wall of the optic cup. Melanocytes differentiating from neural crest (dendritic type) usually become associated with 
skin and hair follicle and less frequently with connective tissue of a great variety of organs. Melanocytes differentiating from the optic cup (nondendritic 
type) are found only in the retinal epithelium.

<P>It has been possible with many color mutants to distinguish between two alternative modes of gene action by transplantation of embryonic tissue or 
undifferentiated skin to hosts of unlike color genotype, <I>i.e.</I>, whether the site of gene action is within, or outside, the melanoblast. The production 
of phaeomelanin in hair follicles is dependent on follicular environment of the melanocytes under the control of agouti-series alleles. Gene action at other 
loci studied resides within the melanoblast and fine-structure analysis of some of these have revealed differences in periodicity of synthetic sites of 
melanin or organization of the protein matrix in the developing melanocyte (melanosome). It is more difficult to trace the pathway between primary gene 
product and effect in those color mutants whose phenotype is a function of cells surrounding the melanocyte. Melanocytes of hair follicles that normally 
produce eumelanin when cultured <I>in vitro</I> can experimentally be made to produce phaeomelanin on addition of sulfhydryl compounds to the culture medium. 
The type of pigment produced <I>in situ</I> is associated with mitotic rate in the hair bulb. These findings have contributed significantly to our understanding 
of, but do not yet define gene action at, the agouti locus.

<P>It is generally agreed that melanocytes in white spotted areas of mutant mice are either absent, undifferentiated, or abnormally differentiated. Since genes 
causing white spotting may act at any stage from differentiation of melanoblasts from neural crest, through migration, to their differentiation into melanocytes 
at defined sites, the problem becomes one of placing time of gene action and of assessing relative importance of melanoblast and melanoblast-environment. In 
some types of white spotting, neural crest disturbance probably interferes with the differentiation of melanoblasts from crest cells or the migration of melanoblasts. 
There is experimental evidence for the presence of amelanotic melanocytes in white spotted areas of some mutants and equal evidence for their absence in white 
spotted areas of other mutants. In one belted mutant melanocytes have been demonstrated by tissue transplants in the vicinity of hair follicles in prospective 
white areas of fetal skin. Either the melanoblasts fail to survive and differentiate or are unable to gain entrance into developing hair follicles.

<P>Variegated spotting (mottling) is related in some cases to an active state of one X chromosome (or part of the X chromosome) and to inactivity of its 
homologue in given parts of the integument. Thus a female mouse heterozygous for a pigment gene located on the X chromosome may show at least two alternative types of pigment.

<P>Biochemical studies suggest that the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:98880" target="_blank"><I>c</I></A> 
locus controls the structure of tyrosine and that the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:98881" target="_blank"><I>b</I></A> 
locus alters the amount of tyrosinase deposited on the fibers in a pigment granule. In the process the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:98881" target="_blank"><I>b</I></A> 
locus must also alter the shape of the mature granule. Possibly subunits of the protein controlled by the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:98881" target="_blank"><I>b</I></A> 
locus make up the parallel fibers seen in early melanosomes and bind the product of the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:98880" target="_blank"><I>c</I></A> 
locus (tyrosinase) in a certain fixed ratio. Since brown skins have more tyrosinase activity than black skins and approximately the same number of granules, 
it appears that the protein produced by the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:98881" target="_blank"><I>b</I></A> 
locus, as well as providing a structural framework for the attachment of the tyrosinase molecules, also influences the activity of these molecules, 
and this in turn must alter the final molecular structure of the melanin synthesized. The 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:97454" target="_blank"><I>p</I></A> 
locus appears to control the protein which provides the cross-linkages seen in the early melanosomes. This cross-linkage is basic to the structure of the 
final granule and probably influences tyrosinase activity in many ways.
