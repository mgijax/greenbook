<H2>A User's Guide to <I>Biology of the Laboratory Mouse</I></H2>

<P><B>Introduction</B>

<P>The purpose of this User's Guide is to assist you in using all of the features of the electronic version of <I>Biology of the Laboratory Mouse</I>.

<P><B>Navigation</B>

<P>There are several ways to navigate through this book:

<UL>
<LI>The Table of Contents</LI>
<LI>The abbreviated Table of Contents in the left column of most pages</LI>
<LI>The <B>Previous</B> and <B>Next</B> links at the top and bottom of most pages</LI>
<LI>Internal links within the body of the text</LI>
</UL>

<P>The 
<A HREF="contents.shtml">Table of Contents</A> lists Chapter and subchapter headings. Click on any link in the Table of Contents to go to that section of the text.

<P>See 
<A HREF="frames/frame1.shtml">Chapter 1</A> for an example of the abbreviated Table of Contents and the <B>Previous</B> and <B>Next</B> links.

<P>Internal links in the body of the text may refer to other sections of the book, including references and footnotes.

<H3>Special Features</H3>

<P><B>References:</B> Citations within the body of the text are linked to the appropriate reference in the <B>References</B> section. 
Many of the references are also in the body of literature curated by Mouse Genome Informatics. 
These will have a link to the citation in MGI below the citation in the <B>References</B> section. 
Clicking the link to MGI will take you to the references detail page at MGI. 
For example, 
<A HREF="#ref24-100">Snell, G.D. 1958<I>b</I></A> is also curated at MGI. Clicking the link to MGI lets you search for Genes, Markers and Phenotypes, 
Marker Mapping Information, or Molecular Probes and Segments in MGI from this reference. This page also links to the citation in PubMed. 
Other references are not curated at MGI, but are curated in PubMed. For example, 
<A HREF="#ref24-99">Snell, G.D. 1958<I>a</I></A> is such a citation. Clicking the link to PubMed take you to the page containing the Abstract and several 
useful search features: click <B>Related Articles</B> to see references that may be more up to date, or <B>Books</B> to see chapters from reference works related to 
the subject of the reference.

<P><B>Genes:</B> All mouse genes and alleles mentioned in the text are linked to MGI pages containing information on those genes, including current nomenclature. 
The link may be to an allele detail page, such as that for the gene referred to in the text as the albino (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->accession/MGI:1855976" target="_blank"></I>c</I></A>) locus. 

<P><B>Tables:</B> Clicking a reference to a Table within the text will cause that Table to appear in a new browser window (see, for example, 
<a href="javascript:windowt71 = window.open('tables/table7-1.shtml', 'windowt71', 'width=800,height=500,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt71.focus()">Table 7-1</A>). 
All Tables are listed on the 
<A HREF="frames/frametables.shtml">Tables</A> page.

<P><B>Figures:</B> Clicking a reference to a Figure within the text will cause that Figure to appear in a new browser window (see, for example, 
<a href="javascript:windowf1301 = window.open('figures/figure13-1.shtml', 'windowf1301', 'width=600,height=800,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf1301.focus()">Figure 13-1</A>). 
All Figures are listed on the 
<A HREF="frames/framefigures.shtml">Figures</A> page. In addition, the 
<A HREF="frames/frameimageindex.shtml">Image Index</A> contains thumbnail images of all figures.

<H3>A Note on Printing</H3>
