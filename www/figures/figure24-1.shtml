<P>Figure 24-1. Diagram showing the expected portion of susceptible and resistant mice in an F<SUB>2</SUB> 
generation when susceptibility and resistance are determined by two loci both showing codominance. Grafts 
from strain A will grow in those, and only those, recipients carrying both <I>H-1<SUP>a</SUP></I> and 
<I>H-2<SUP>a</SUP></I>. In like manner, grafts from strain B require the presence of both <I>H-1<SUP>a</SUP></I> 
and <I>H-2<SUP>a</SUP></I>.
