<P>Figure 33-13. Inheritance of exploratory behavior in F<SUB>1</SUB> hybrid mice. The diagonal is the "midpoint line," <I>i.e.</I>, 
a line based on the mean scores for parental stocks plotted on both axes. Scores of F<SUB>1</SUB> hybrids are arranged along the 
abscissa over the appropriate midparent value. The mean score for the hybrid is indicated along the ordinate. Note that most hybrids 
scored above the midparent line, and that the mean of the 18 hybrids whose parents were related (bull's-eye) is less than that of 
the 13 hybrids whose parents were unrelated (cross). (<I>From</I>
