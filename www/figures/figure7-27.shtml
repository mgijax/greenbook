<P>Figure 7-27. Midmeiotic stages in the female mouse. All from adult ovaries, 
sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (x900; <I>H</I> x600). (<I>Courtesy of Dr. W. Kuhlmann</I>.) 
<I>A</I>. "Chromatin mass I" showing aggregation of chromatic material (condensation 
of chromosomes) and weakening of nuclear membrane; 
<I>B</I>, "transitional phase I" showing absence of nuclear membrance and relaxation 
of the chromatin mass into discrete bivalents; 
<I>C</I>, "forming spindle I" with bivalents vecoming oriented among the fibers; 
<I>D</I>, metaphase I, side view. Central bulges in the bivalents indicate terminalizing chiasmata; 
<I>E</I>, early anaphase I showing separation of tetrads into component dyads; 
<I>F</I>, late anaphase I. Thickening of spindle fibers at the equator to from rudiments of midbody; 
<I>G</I>, end of anaphase I. "Chromatin mass II" forming from aggregation of chromosomes 
at inner pole of spindle, polar body I forming at the outer pole; 
thickening of midbody rudiments; rotation of spindle toward perpendicular position; 
<I>H</I>, telophase I. Compression of midbody by the constriction of the limiting 
membrane which separates polar body I from the secondary oocyte. 
"Chromatin mass II" at the inner pole of the spindle; 
<I>I</I>, "Chromatin mass II." The cup-shaped aggregate of dyads marks the first stage 
of the secondary oocyte.
