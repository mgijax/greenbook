<P>Figure 12-30. Diagram of the circulatory system in an 8-day 10-hour, 10-somite embryo. 
The head and tail folds of this embryo have begun to turn but there is as yet no turning in the midtrunk region. 
Traces of the allantoic veins are present but are not shown as they do not yet form a continuous channel (x 64).
